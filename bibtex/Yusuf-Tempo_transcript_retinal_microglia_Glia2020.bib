abstract = {Myeloid cells such as resident retinal microglia (MG) or
            infiltrating blood-derived macrophages (Mϕ) accumulate in areas
            of retinal ischemia and neovascularization (RNV) and modulate
            neovascular eye disease. Their temporospatial distribution and
            biological function in this process, however, remain unclarified.
            Using state-of-the-art methods, including cell-specific reporter
            mice and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA Seq), this study
            determined the extent of MG proliferation and Mϕ infiltration in
            areas with retinal ischemia and RNV in Cx3cr1CreERT2
            :Rosa26-tdTomato mice and examined the transcriptional profile of
            MG in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). For
            RNA Seq, tdTomato-positive retinal MG were sorted by flow
            cytometry followed by Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis.
            Furthermore, intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation
            marker 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) were performed from
            postnatal day (p) 12 to p16. We found that MG is the predominant
            myeloid cell population while Mϕ rarely appears in areas of RNV.
            Thirty percent of retinal MG in areas of RNV were EdU-positive
            indicating a considerable local MG cell expansion. GO cluster
            analysis revealed an enrichment of clusters related to cell
            division, tubulin binding, ATPase activity, protein kinase
            regulatory activity, and chemokine receptor binding in MG in the
            OIR model compared to untreated controls. In conclusion,
            activated retinal MG alter their transcriptional profile, exhibit
            considerable proliferative ability and are by far the most
            frequent myeloid cell population in areas of ischemia and RNV in
            the OIR model thus presenting a potential target for future
            therapeutic approaches.}
