abstract = { The natural language system DISCO is described. It
            combines a powerful and flexible grammar development
            system; linguistic competence for German including
            morphology, syntax and semantics; new methods for
            linguistic performance modeling on the basis of
            high-level competence grammars; new methods for
            modelling multi-agent dialogue competence; an
            interesting sample application for appointment
            scheduling and calendar management. }
