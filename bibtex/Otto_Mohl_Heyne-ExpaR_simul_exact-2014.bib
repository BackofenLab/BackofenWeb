abstract = {BackgroundIdentifying sequence-structure motifs common to 
            two RNAs can speed up the comparison of structural RNAs 
            substantially. The core algorithm of the existent approach 
            ExpaRNA solves this problem for a priori known input 
            structures. However, such structures are rarely known; 
            moreover, predicting them computationally is no rescue, 
            since single sequence structure prediction is highly 
            unreliable.ResultsThe novel algorithm ExpaRNA-P computes 
            exactly matching sequence-structure motifs in entire 
            Boltzmann-distributed structure ensembles of two RNAs; 
            thereby we match and fold RNAs simultaneously, analogous to 
            the well-known inverted question marksimultaneous alignment 
            and folding inverted question mark of RNAs. While this 
            implies much higher flexibility compared to ExpaRNA, 
            ExpaRNA-P has the same very low complexity (quadratic in 
            time and space), which is enabled by its novel structure 
            ensemble-based sparsification. Furthermore, we devise a 
            generalized chaining algorithm to compute compatible subsets 
            of ExpaRNA-P inverted question marks sequence-structure 
            motifs. Resulting in the very fast RNA alignment approach 
            ExpLoc-P, we utilize the best chain as anchor constraints 
            for the sequence-structure alignment tool LocARNA. ExpLoc-P 
            is benchmarked in several variants and versus 
            state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we formally 
            introduce and evaluate strict and relaxed variants of the 
            problem; the latter makes the approach sensitive to 
            compensatory mutations. Across a benchmark set of typical 
            non-coding RNAs, ExpLoc-P has similar accuracy to LocARNA 
            but is four times faster (in both variants), while it 
            achieves a speed-up over 30-fold for the longest benchmark 
            sequences ( inverted question mark400nt). Finally, different 
            ExpLoc-P variants enable tailoring of the method to specific 
            application scenarios. ExpaRNA-P and ExpLoc-P are 
            distributed as part of the LocARNA package. The source code 
            is freely available at 
            http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/ExpaRNA-P.Conclusions 
            ExpaRNA-P inverted question marks novel ensemble-based 
            sparsification reduces its complexity to quadratic time and 
            space. Thereby, ExpaRNA-P significantly speeds up 
            sequence-structure alignment while maintaining the alignment 
            quality. Different ExpaRNA-P variants support a wide range 
            of applications.}
