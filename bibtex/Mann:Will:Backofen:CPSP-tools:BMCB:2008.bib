abstract = {Background: The principles of protein folding and evolution pose 
            problems of very high inherent complexity. 
            Often these problems are tackled using simplified protein models,
            e.g. lattice proteins.
            The CPSP-tools package provides programs to solve exactly and completely
            the problems typical of studies using 3D lattice protein models. 
            Among the tasks addressed are the prediction of (all) globally optimal
            and/or suboptimal structures as well as sequence design and neutral 
            network exploration.
            
            Results: In contrast to stochastic approaches, which are
            not capable of answering many fundamental questions, our methods
            are based on fast, non-heuristic techniques.
            The  resulting tools are designed for high-throughput studies of
            3D-lattice proteins utilizing the Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model.

            Conclusions: The CPSP-tools package is the first set
            of exact and complete methods for 
            extensive, high-throughput studies of non-restricted 3D-lattice
            protein models. In particular, our package deals with cubic and
            face centered cubic (FCC) lattices.}
