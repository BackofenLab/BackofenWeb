abstract = {{The Galaxy HiCExplorer provides a web service at https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu. It enables the integrative analysis of chromosome conformation by providing tools and computational resources to pre-process, analyse and visualize Hi-C, Capture Hi-C (cHi-C) and single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) data. Since the last publication, Galaxy HiCExplorer has been expanded considerably with new tools to facilitate the analysis of cHi-C and to provide an in-depth analysis of Hi-C data. Moreover, it supports the analysis of scHi-C data by offering a broad range of tools. With the help of the standard graphical user interface of Galaxy, presented workflows, extensive documentation and tutorials, novices as well as Hi-C experts are supported in their Hi-C data analysis with Galaxy HiCExplorer.}}
