abstract = {Marine algae are known to contain a wide variety of 
            bioactive compounds, many of which have commercial 
            applications in pharmaceutical, medical, cosmetic, 
            nutraceutical, food and agricultural industries. Natural 
            antioxidants, found in many algae, are important bioactive 
            compounds that play an important role against various 
            diseases and ageing processes through protection of cells 
            from oxidative damage. In this respect, relatively little is 
            known about the bioactivity of Hawaiian algae that could be 
            a potential natural source of such antioxidants. The total 
            antioxidant activity of organic extracts of 37 algal 
            samples, comprising of 30 species of Hawaiian algae from 27 
            different genera was determined. The activity was determined 
            by employing the FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) 
            assays. Of the algae tested, the extract of Turbinaria 
            ornata was found to be the most active. Bioassay-guided 
            fractionation of this extract led to the isolation of a 
            variety of different carotenoids as the active principles. 
            The major bioactive antioxidant compound was identified as 
            the carotenoid fucoxanthin. These results show, for the 
            first time, that numerous Hawaiian algae exhibit significant 
            antioxidant activity, a property that could lead to their 
            application in one of many useful healthcare or related 
            products as well as in chemoprevention of a variety of 
            diseases including cancer.}
