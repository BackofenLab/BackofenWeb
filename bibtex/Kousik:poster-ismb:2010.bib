abstract = {Computational identification of SH2-peptide interactions is an open problem with high relevance. In this study we applied combined machine learning approaches to identify interacting and non-interacting pairs of SH2 domains and phosphotyrosine containing peptides. We achieved an acceptable area under the ROC curve score of 0.89 with 10-fold cross-validation.}
