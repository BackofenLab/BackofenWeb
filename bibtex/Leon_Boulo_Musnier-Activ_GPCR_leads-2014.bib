abstract = {The control of mRNA translation has been mainly explored in 
            response to activated tyrosine kinase receptors. In 
            contrast, mechanistic details on the translational machinery 
            are far less available in the case of ligand-bound G 
            protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, using the 
            FSH receptor (FSH-R) as a model receptor, we demonstrate 
            that part of the translational regulations occurs by 
            phosphorylation of the translation pre-initiation complex 
            scaffold protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), 
            in HEK293 cells stably expressing the FSH-R. This 
            phosphorylation event occurred when eIF4G was bound to the 
            mRNA 5' cap, and probably involves mammalian target of 
            rapamycin. This regulation might contribute to cap-dependent 
            translation in response to FSH. The cap-binding protein 
            eIF4E also had its phosphorylation level enhanced upon FSH 
            stimulation. We also show that FSH-induced signaling not 
            only led to cap-dependent translation but also to internal 
            ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation of some 
            mRNA. These data add detailed information on the molecular 
            bases underlying the regulation of selective mRNA 
            translation by a GPCR, and a topological model 
            recapitulating these mechanisms is proposed.}
