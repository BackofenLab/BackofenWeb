abstract = {In the early 1970's, gel electrophoresis was a novel technique in 
            biochemistry labs.  Now used as the work horse in genomic sequencing
            projects, molecular biology has
            undergone an incredibly rapid development, currently yielding so much raw
            data,
            that efficient computer algorithms are mandatory for data analysis.
            The interdisciplinary field of
            <I>computational biology</I>, or <I>bioinformatics</I>,
            includes both  theoretical and practical contributions
            from computer science, mathematics and biology and
            involves the development of
            mathematical models, statistical analysis,
            computer simulation, efficient algorithms, database
            systems, web interface, etc.
            
            This text is meant to be a self-contained introduction
            to computational biology, where we provide the background
            mathematics required to understand <I>why</I>
            certain algorithms work. For instance, it seems to us that one must
            understand the underlying probability theory for development
            of hidden Markov models, rather than simply present the
            pseudocode for this important motif recognition algorithm.
            As a learning tool, many of the algorithms described in this book
            have prototype implementations in C/C++ and sometimes Java,
            whose source code can be found
            on the web pages for this book at Wiley's WWW-Site.
