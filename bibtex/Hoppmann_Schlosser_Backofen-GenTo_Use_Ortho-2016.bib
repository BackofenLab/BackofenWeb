abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) evaluate 
            associations between genetic variants and a trait or disease 
            of interest free of prior biological hypotheses. GWAS 
            require stringent correction for multiple testing, with 
            genome-wide significance typically defined as association 
            p-value <5*10-8. This study presents a new tool that uses 
            external information about genes to prioritize SNP 
            associations (GenToS). For a given list of candidate genes, 
            GenToS calculates an appropriate statistical significance 
            threshold and then searches for trait-associated variants in 
            summary statistics from human GWAS. It thereby allows for 
            identifying trait-associated genetic variants that do not 
            meet genome-wide significance. The program additionally 
            tests for enrichment of significant candidate gene 
            associations in the human GWAS data compared to the number 
            expected by chance. As proof of principle, this report used 
            external information from a comprehensive resource of 
            genetically manipulated and systematically phenotyped mice. 
            Based on selected murine phenotypes for which human GWAS 
            data for corresponding traits were publicly available, 
            several candidate gene input lists were derived. Using 
            GenToS for the investigation of candidate genes underlying 
            murine skeletal phenotypes in data from a large human 
            discovery GWAS meta-analysis of bone mineral density 
            resulted in the identification of significantly associated 
            variants in 29 genes. Index variants in 28 of these loci 
            were subsequently replicated in an independent GWAS 
            replication step, highlighting that they are true positive 
            associations. One signal, COL11A1, has not been discovered 
            through GWAS so far and represents a novel human candidate 
            gene for altered bone mineral density. The number of 
            observed genes that contained significant SNP associations 
            in human GWAS based on murine candidate gene input lists was 
            much greater than the number expected by chance across 
            several complex human traits (enrichment p-value as low as 
            10-10). GenToS can be used with any candidate gene list, any 
            GWAS summary file, runs on a desktop computer and is freely 
            available.}
