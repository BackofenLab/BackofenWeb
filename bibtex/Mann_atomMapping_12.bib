abstract = {The mass  ow in a chemical reaction network is 
            determined by the propagation of atoms from educt to product molecules 
            within each of the constituent chemical reactions. The Atom Mapping Problem for a given chemical 
            reaction is the computational task of determining the correspondences 
            of the atoms between educt and product molecules. We propose here a 
            Constraint Programming approach to identify atom mappings for 
            "elementary" reactions. These feature a cyclic imaginary transition 
            state (ITS) imposing an additional strong constraint on the bijection 
            between educt and product atoms. The ongoing work presented here 
            identifies only chemically feasible ITSs by integrating the cyclic 
            structure of the chemical transformation into the search.}
