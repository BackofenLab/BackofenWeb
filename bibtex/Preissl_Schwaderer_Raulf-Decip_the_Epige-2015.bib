abstract = {RATIONALE: Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial for cell 
            identity and transcriptional control. The heart consists of 
            different cell types including cardiac myocytes, endothelial 
            cells, fibroblasts and others. Therefore, cell type-specific 
            analysis is needed to gain mechanistic insight into the 
            regulation of gene expression in cardiac myocytes. While 
            cytosolic mRNA represents steady-state levels, nuclear mRNA 
            more closely reflects transcriptional activity. To unravel 
            epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional control, cell 
            type-specific analysis of nuclear mRNA and epigenetic 
            modifications is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to purify 
            cardiac myocyte nuclei from hearts of different species by 
            magnetic- or fluorescent-assisted sorting and to determine 
            the nuclear and cellular RNA expression profiles and 
            epigenetic marks in a cardiac myocyte-specific manner. 
            METHODS AND RESULTS: Frozen cardiac tissue samples were used 
            to isolate cardiac myocyte nuclei. High sorting purity was 
            confirmed for cardiac myocyte nuclei isolated from mice, 
            rats and humans. Deep sequencing of nuclear RNA revealed a 
            major fraction of nascent, unspliced RNA in contrast to 
            results obtained from purified cardiac myocytes. Cardiac 
            myocyte nuclear and cellular RNA expression profiles showed 
            differences especially for metabolic genes. Genome-wide maps 
            of the transcriptional elongation mark H3K36me3 were 
            generated by chromatin-immunoprecipitation. Transcriptome 
            and epigenetic data confirmed the high degree of cardiac 
            myocyte-specificity of our protocol. An integrative analysis 
            of nuclear mRNA and histone mark occurrence indicated a 
            major impact of the chromatin state on transcriptional 
            activity in cardiac myocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
            establishes cardiac myocyte-specific sorting of nuclei as a 
            universal method to investigate epigenetic and 
            transcriptional processes in cardiac myocytes of different 
            origins. These data sets provide novel insight into cardiac 
            myocyte transcription.}
