abstract = {SUMMARY: SECISDesign is a server for the design of 
            SECIS-elements and arbitrary RNA-elements within the coding 
            sequence of an mRNA. The element has to satisfy both 
            structure and sequence constraints. At the same time, a 
            certain amino acid similarity to the original protein has to 
            be kept. The designed sequence can be used for recombinant 
            expression of selenoproteins in Escherichia coli. 
            AVAILABILITY: The server is available at 
            http://www.bio.inf.uni-jena.de/Software/SECISDesign/index.html.}
