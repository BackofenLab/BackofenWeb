abstract = {There is probably no major adaptive response in bacteria 
            which does not have at least one small RNA (sRNA) as part of 
            its regulatory network controlling gene expression. Thus, 
            prokaryotic genomes encode dozens to hundreds of these 
            riboregulators. Whereas the identification of putative sRNA 
            genes during initial genome annotation is not yet common 
            practice, their prediction can be done subsequently by 
            various methods and with variable efficacy, frequently 
            relying on comparative genome analysis. A large number of 
            these sRNAs interact with their mRNA targets by antisense 
            mechanisms. Yet, the computational identification of these 
            targets appears to be challenging because frequently the 
            partial and incomplete sequence complementarity is difficult 
            to evaluate. Here we review the computational approaches for 
            detecting bacterial sRNA genes and their targets, and 
            discuss the current and future challenges that this exciting 
            field of research is facing.}
