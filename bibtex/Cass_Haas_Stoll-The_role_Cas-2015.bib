abstract = {CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic 
            Repeat) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive 
            immunity to repel invasive genetic elements. Type I systems 
            use "Cascade" ribonucleoprotein complexes to target invader 
            DNA, by base pairing CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to protospacers. 
            Cascade identifies PAMs (Protospacer Adjacent Motifs) on 
            invader DNA, triggering R-loop formation and subsequent DNA 
            degradation by Cas3. Cas8 is a candidate PAM recognition 
            factor in some Cascades. We analysed Cas8 homologues from 
            type IB CRISPR systems in archaea Haloferax volcanii (Hvo) 
            and Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (Mth). Cas8 was 
            essential for CRISPR interference in Hvo, and purified Mth 
            Cas8 protein responded to PAM sequence when binding to 
            nucleic acids. Cas8 interacted physically with 
            Cas5-Cas7-crRNA complex, stimulating binding to PAM 
            containing substrates. Mutation of conserved Cas8 amino acid 
            residues abolished interference in vivo, and altered 
            catalytic activity of Cas8 protein in vitro. This is 
            experimental evidence that Cas8 is important for targeting 
            Cascade to invader DNA.}
