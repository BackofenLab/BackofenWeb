abstract = {Lattice protein models are used for hierarchical
            approaches to protein structure prediction, as well
            as for investigating general principles of protein
            folding. So far, one has the problem that either the
            lattice does not model real protein conformations
            with good quality, or there is no efficient method
            known for finding native conformations. We present a
            constraint-based method that largely improves this
            situ- ation. It outperforms all existing approaches
            in lattice protein folding on the type of model we
            have chosen (namely the HP-model by Lau and
            Dill[34], which models the important aspect of
            hydrophobicity). It is the only exact method that
            has been applied to two different
            lattices. Furthermore, it is the only exact method
            for the face-centered cubic lattice. This lattice
            is important since it has been shown [38] that the
            FCC lattice can model real protein conformations
            with coordinate root mean square deviation below 2
            Angstrom. Our method uses a constraint-based approach. It
            works by first calculating maximally compact sets
            of points (hydrophobic cores), and then threading
            the given HP-sequence to the hydrophobic cores such
            that the core is occupied by H-monomers.}
