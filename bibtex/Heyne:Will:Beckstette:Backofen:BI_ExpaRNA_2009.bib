            MOTIVATION: Specific functions of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules are often 
            associated with different motifs in the RNA structure. The key feature that 
            forms such an RNA motif is the combination of sequence and structure 
            properties. In this article, we introduce a new RNA sequence-structure 
            comparison method which maintains exact matching substructures. Existing 
            common substructures are treated as whole unit while variability is allowed 
            between such structural motifs. Based on a fast detectable set of overlapping 
            and crossing substructure matches for two nested RNA secondary structures, 
            our method ExpaRNA (exact pattern of alignment of RNA) computes the longest 
            collinear sequence of substructures common to two RNAs in O(H*nm) time and 
            O(nm) space, where H << n.m for real RNA structures. Applied to different 
            RNAs, our method correctly identifies sequence-structure similarities between
            two RNAs. 
            
            RESULTS: We have compared ExpaRNA with two other alignment methods
            that work with given RNA structures, namely RNAforester and RNA_align. The 
            results are in good agreement, but can be obtained in a fraction of running
            time, in particular for larger RNAs. We have also used ExpaRNA to speed up 
            state-of-the-art Sankoff-style alignment tools like LocARNA, and observe a
            tradeoff between quality and speed. However, we get a speedup of 4.25 even
            in the highest quality setting, where the quality of the produced 
            alignment is comparable to that of LocARNA alone. 
            
            AVAILABILITY: The presented algorithm is implemented in the program ExpaRNA, which is 
            available from our website (http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software).}
