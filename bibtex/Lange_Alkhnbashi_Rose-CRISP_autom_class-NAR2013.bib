            Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas systems are repeated RNA 
            sequences that serve as Cas-protein-binding templates. 
            Classification is based on the architectural composition of 
            associated Cas proteins, considering repeat evolution is 
            essential to complete the picture. We compiled the largest 
            data set of CRISPRs to date, performed comprehensive, 
            independent clustering analyses and identified a novel set 
            of 40 conserved sequence families and 33 potential structure 
            motifs for Cas-endoribonucleases with some distinct 
            conservation patterns. Evolutionary relationships are 
            presented as a hierarchical map of sequence and structure 
            similarities for both a quick and detailed insight into the 
            diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems. In a comparison with 
            Cas-subtypes, I-C, I-E, I-F and type II were strongly 
            coupled and the remaining type I and type III subtypes were 
            loosely coupled to repeat and Cas1 evolution, respectively. 
            Subtypes with a strong link to CRISPR evolution were almost 
            exclusive to bacteria; nevertheless, we identified rare 
            examples of potential horizontal transfer of I-C and I-E 
            systems into archaeal organisms. Our easy-to-use web server 
            provides an automated assignment of newly sequenced CRISPRs 
            to our classification system and enables more informed 
            choices on future hypotheses in CRISPR-Cas research:
