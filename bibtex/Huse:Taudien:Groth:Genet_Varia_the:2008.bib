abstract = {Background/Aims: Prostate cancer represents the cancer with 
            the highest worldwide prevalence in men. Chromosome 8p23 has 
            shown suggestive genetic linkage to early-onset familial 
            prostate cancer and is frequently deleted in cancer cells of 
            the urogenital tract. Within this locus some beta-defensin 
            genes (among them DEFB4, DEFB103, DEFB104) are localized, 
            which are arranged in a gene cluster shown to exhibit an 
            extensive copy number variation in the population. This 
            structural variation considerably hampers genetic studies. 
            In a new approach considering both sequence as well as copy 
            number variations we aimed to compare the defensin locus at 
            8p23 in prostate cancer patients and controls. Methods: We 
            apply PCR/cloning-based haplotyping and high-throughput copy 
            number determination methods which allow assessment of both 
            individual haplotypes and gene copy numbers not accessible 
            to conventional SNP-based genotyping. Results: We 
            demonstrate association of four common DEFB104 haplotypes 
            with the risk of prostate cancer in two independent patient 
            cohorts. Moreover, we show that high copy numbers (>9) of 
            the defensin gene cluster are significantly underrepresented 
            in both patient samples. Conclusions: Our findings imply a 
            role of the antibacterial defensins in prostate 
            cancerogenesis qualifying distinct gene variants and copy 
            numbers as potential tumor markers.}
