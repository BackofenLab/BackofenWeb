abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing is a major 
            contributor to the diversity of eukaryotic transcriptomes 
            and proteomes. Currently, large scale detection of 
            alternative splicing using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or 
            microarrays does not capture all alternative splicing 
            events. Moreover, for many species genomic data is being 
            produced at a far greater rate than corresponding transcript 
            data, hence in silico methods of predicting alternative 
            splicing have to be improved. RESULTS: Here, we show that 
            the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) allows accurate 
            prediction of evolutionary conserved exon skipping events. 
            At a stringent false positive rate of 0.5%, our BN achieves 
            an improved true positive rate of 61%, compared to a 
            previously reported 50% on the same dataset using support 
            vector machines (SVMs). Incorporating several novel 
            discriminative features such as intronic splicing regulatory 
            elements leads to the improvement. Features related to mRNA 
            secondary structure increase the prediction performance, 
            corroborating previous findings that secondary structures 
            are important for exon recognition. Random labelling tests 
            rule out overfitting. Cross-validation on another dataset 
            confirms the increased performance. When using the same 
            dataset and the same set of features, the BN matches the 
            performance of an SVM in earlier literature. Remarkably, we 
            could show that about half of the exons which are labelled 
            constitutive but receive a high probability of being 
            alternative by the BN, are in fact alternative exons 
            according to the latest EST data. Finally, we predict exon 
            skipping without using conservation-based features, and 
            achieve a true positive rate of 29% at a false positive rate 
            of 0.5%. CONCLUSION: BNs can be used to achieve accurate 
            identification of alternative exons and provide clues about 
            possible dependencies between relevant features. The 
            near-identical performance of the BN and SVM when using the 
            same features shows that good classification depends more on 
            features than on the choice of classifier. Conservation 
            based features continue to be the most informative, and 
            hence distinguishing alternative exons from constitutive 
            ones without using conservation based features remains a 
            challenging problem.}
