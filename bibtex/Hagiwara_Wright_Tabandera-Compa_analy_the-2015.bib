abstract = {Antioxidant activity of symbiotic organisms known as 
            lichens is an intriguing field of research because of its 
            strong contribution to their ability to withstand extremes 
            of physical and biological stress (e.g. desiccation, 
            temperature, UV radiation and microbial infection). We 
            present a comparative study on the antioxidant activities of 
            76 Icelandic and 41 Hawaiian lichen samples assessed 
            employing the DPPH- and FRAP-based antioxidant assays. 
            Utilizing this unprecedented sample size, we show that while 
            highest individual sample activity is present in the 
            Icelandic dataset, the overall antioxidant activity is 
            higher for lichens found in Hawaii. Furthermore, we report 
            that lichens from the genus Peltigera that have been 
            described as strong antioxidant producers in studies on 
            Chinese, Russian and Turkish lichens also show high 
            antioxidant activities in both Icelandic and Hawaiian lichen 
            samples. Finally, we show that opportunistic sampling of 
            lichens in both Iceland and Hawaii will yield high numbers 
            of lichen species that exclusively include green algae as 
            photobiont.}
