abstract = {BACKGROUND: PDZ domains are one of the most promiscuous 
            protein recognition modules that bind with short linear 
            peptides and play an important role in cellular signaling. 
            Recently, few high-throughput techniques (e.g. protein 
            microarray screen, phage display) have been applied to 
            determine in-vitro binding specificity of PDZ domains. 
            Currently, many computational methods are available to 
            predict PDZ-peptide interactions but they often provide 
            domain specific models and/or have a limited domain 
            coverage. RESULTS: Here, we composed the largest set of PDZ 
            domains derived from human, mouse, fly and worm proteomes 
            and defined binding models for PDZ domain families to 
            improve the domain coverage and prediction specificity. For 
            that purpose, we first identified a novel set of 138 PDZ 
            families, comprising of 548 PDZ domains from aforementioned 
            organisms, based on efficient clustering according to their 
            sequence identity. For 43 PDZ families, covering 226 PDZ 
            domains with available interaction data, we built 
            specialized models using a support vector machine approach. 
            The advantage of family-wise models is that they can also be 
            used to determine the binding specificity of a newly 
            characterized PDZ domain with sufficient sequence identity 
            to the known families. Since most current experimental 
            approaches provide only positive data, we have to cope with 
            the class imbalance problem. Thus, to enrich the negative 
            class, we introduced a powerful semi-supervised technique to 
            generate high confidence non-interaction data. We report 
            competitive predictive performance with respect to 
            state-of-the-art approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach has 
            several contributions. First, we show that domain coverage 
            can be increased by applying accurate clustering technique. 
            Second, we developed an approach based on a semi-supervised 
            strategy to get high confidence negative data. Third, we 
            allowed high order correlations between the amino acid 
            positions in the binding peptides. Fourth, our method is 
            general enough and will easily be applicable to other 
            peptide recognition modules such as SH2 domains and finally, 
            we performed a genome-wide prediction for 101 human and 102 
            mouse PDZ domains and uncovered novel interactions with 
            biological relevance. We make all the predictive models and 
            genome-wide predictions freely available to the scientific 
            community.}
