abstract = {RNA binding proteins recognize RNA targets in a sequence 
            specific manner. Apart from the sequence, the secondary 
            structure context of the binding site also affects the 
            binding affinity. Binding sites are often located in 
            single-stranded RNA regions and it was shown that the 
            sequestration of a binding motif in a double-strand 
            abolishes protein binding. Thus, it is desirable to include 
            knowledge about RNA secondary structures when searching for 
            the binding motif of a protein. We present the approach 
            MEMERIS for searching sequence motifs in a set of RNA 
            sequences and simultaneously integrating information about 
            secondary structures. To abstract from specific structural 
            elements, we precompute position-specific values measuring 
            the single-strandedness of all substrings of an RNA 
            sequence. These values are used as prior knowledge about the 
            motif starts to guide the motif search. Extensive tests with 
            artificial and biological data demonstrate that MEMERIS is 
            able to identify motifs in single-stranded regions even if a 
            stronger motif located in double-strand parts exists. The 
            discovered motif occurrences in biological datasets mostly 
            coincide with known protein-binding sites. This algorithm 
            can be used for finding the binding motif of single-stranded 
            RNA-binding proteins in SELEX or other biological sequence 
            data.}
