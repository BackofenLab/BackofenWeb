abstract = {The molecular roles of manyRNA-binding proteins in 
            bacterial post-transcriptional gene regulation are not well 
            understood. Approaches combiningin vivo UVcrosslinking 
            withRNAdeep sequencing (CLIP-seq) have begun to 
            revolutionize the transcriptome-wide mapping of 
            eukaryoticRNA-binding protein target sites. We have 
            appliedCLIP-seq to chart the target landscape of two major 
            bacterial post-transcriptional regulators, Hfq and CsrA, in 
            the model pathogenSalmonellaTyphimurium. By detecting 
            binding sites at single-nucleotide resolution, we 
            identifyRNApreferences and structural constraints of Hfq and 
            CsrA during their interactions with hundreds of cellular 
            transcripts. This reveals 3'-located Rho-independent 
            terminators as a universal motif involved in 
            Hfq-RNAinteractions. Additionally, Hfq preferentially binds 
            5' tosRNA-target sites inmRNAs, and 3' to seed sequences 
            insRNAs, reflecting a simple logic in how Hfq 
            facilitatessRNA-mRNAinteractions. Importantly, global 
            knowledge of Hfq sites significantly improvessRNA-target 
            predictions. CsrA bindsAUGGAsequences in apical loops and 
            targets manySalmonellavirulencemRNAs. Overall, our 
            genericCLIP-seq approach will bring new insights into 
            post-transcriptional gene regulation byRNA-binding proteins 
            in diverse bacterial species.}
