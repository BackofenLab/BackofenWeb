abstract = {The crossdating of tree-ring series is typically based on 
            tree-ring width sequences, which is a crude abstraction of the growth signal stored in tree rings.
            In contrast, intra-annual wood density data allows a much more detailed comparison of wood growth processes
            and new measurement techniques scale well to measure large amounts of samples.
            Thus, chronologies of intra-annual densitometric curves can be built.
            Here, we investigate to what extent intra-annual wood density information can improve crossdating.
            We evaluate different approaches on a data set of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) and compare the results to 
            standard methods that are based on ring width or maximum density.
            Our results show that intra-annual densitometric data indeed increases
            crossdating success rate notably for short tree ring series
            that cover less than 25 years.}
