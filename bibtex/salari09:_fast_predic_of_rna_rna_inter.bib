abstract = {We present an accurate algorithm to predict the minimum
            free energy structure of RNA-RNA interaction under the
            most general type of interaction studied in the
            literature. Moreover, we introduce a fast heuristic
            algorithm to predict multiple binding sites of two
            interacting RNAs incorporating accessibility of target
            sites. We verify the performance of our algorithms for
            joint structure and binding site prediction on a set
            of known interacting RNA pairs. Experimental results
            show that our methods are highly accurate and
            outperform the other competitive approaches.}
