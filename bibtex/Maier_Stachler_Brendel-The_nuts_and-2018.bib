abstract = {Invading genetic elements pose a constant threat to 
            prokaryotic survival, requiring an effective defence. Eleven 
            years ago, the arsenal of known defence mechanisms was 
            expanded by the discovery of the CRISPR-Cas system. Although 
            CRISPR-Cas is present in the majority of archaea, research 
            often focuses on bacterial models. Here, we provide a 
            perspective based on insights gained studying CRISPR-Cas 
            system I-B of the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The system 
            relies on more than 50 different crRNAs, whose stability and 
            maintenance critically depend on the proteins Cas5 and Cas7, 
            which bind the crRNA and form the Cascade complex. The 
            interference activity requires a seed sequence and can 
            interact with multiple PAM sequences. H. volcanii stands out 
            as the first example of an organism that can tolerate 
            autoimmunity via the CRISPR-Cas system while maintaining a 
            constitutively active system. In addition, the H. volcanii 
            system was successfully developed into a tool for gene 
            regulation.}
