abstract = {Studies on proteins are often restricted to highly 
            simplified models to face the immense computational 
            complexity of the associated problems. Constraint-based 
            protein structure prediction (CPSP) tools is a package of 
            very fast algorithms for ab initio optimal structure 
            prediction and related problems in 3D HP-models [cubic and 
            face centered cubic (FCC)]. Here, we present CPSP-web-tools, 
            an interactive online interface of these programs for their 
            immediate use. They include the first method for the direct 
            prediction of optimal energies and structures in 3D HP 
            side-chain models. This newest extension of the CPSP 
            approach is described here for the first time. AVAILABILITY
