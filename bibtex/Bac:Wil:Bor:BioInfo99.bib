abstract = {Predicting the ground state of biopolymers is a
            notoriously hard problem in biocomputing.  Model systems, such as
            lattice proteins are simple tools and valuable to test and improve
            new methods.  Best known are HP-type models with sequences composed
            from a binary (hydrophobic and polar) alphabet.  Major drawback is
            the degeneracy, i.e. the number of different ground state
            conformations.  
            
            Here we show how recently developed constraint
            programming techniques can be used to solve the structure prediction
            problem efficiently for a higher order alphabet.  To our knowledge
            it is the first report of an exact and computationally feasible
            solution to model proteins of length up to 36 and without resorting
            to maximally compact states.  We further show that degeneracy is
            reduced by more than one order of magnitude and that ground state
            conformations are not necessarily compact.  Therefore, more
            realistic protein simulations become feasible with our model.}
