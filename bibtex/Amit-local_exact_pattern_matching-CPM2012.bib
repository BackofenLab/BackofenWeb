abstract = {Detecting local common sequence-structure regions of
            RNAs is a biologically meaningful problem. By
            detecting such regions, biologists are able to
            identify functional similarity between the inspected
            molecules. We developed dynamic programming
            algorithms for finding common structure-sequence
            patterns between two RNAs. The RNAs are given by
            their sequence and a set of potential base pairs
            with associated probabilities. In contrast to prior
            work which matches fixed structures, we support the
            arc breaking edit operation; this allows to match
            only a subset of the given base pairs. We present an
            $O(n^3)$ algorithm for local exact pattern matching
            between two nested RNAs, and an $O(n^3 logn)$
            algorithm for one nested RNA and one
            bounded-unlimited RNA.}
