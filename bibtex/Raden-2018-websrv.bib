abstract = {The Freiburg RNA tools webserver is a well established online resource for RNA-focused research. It provides a unified user interface and comprehensive result visualization for efficient command line tools. The webserver includes RNA-RNA interaction prediction (IntaRNA, CopraRNA, metaMIR), sRNA homology search (GLASSgo), sequence-structure alignments (LocARNA, MARNA, CARNA, ExpaRNA), CRISPR repeat classification (CRISPRmap), sequence design (antaRNA, INFO-RNA, SECISDesign), structure aberration evaluation of point mutations (RaSE), and RNA/protein-family models visualization (CMV), and other methods. Open education resources offer interactive visualizations of RNA structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction as well as basic and advanced sequence alignment algorithms. The services are freely available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de.}
