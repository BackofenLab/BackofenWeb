abstract = {A major challenge in RNA structure analysis is to 
            infer common catalytic or regulatory functions based
            on primary sequences and secondary structures. Some
            programs have been developed that compare RNAs with
            such given structures. Nevertheless, the most
            important problem is that it is hard to determine
            the adopted structures of RNAs which are a necessary
            prerequisite to numerous applications; once a
            structure has been assigned to a sequence (e.g. the
            minimum free energy structure), it influences the
            output of the programs and thus affects the
            scientific result, especially when dealing with a
            set of multiple RNAs. In this paper, we go one step
            further and analyze distances between RNA structure
            ensembles. They reflect structural relationships
            computed basically on base-pairing probability
            matrices.  We propose a distance measure between two
            base-pairing probability matrices showing similar or
            non-similar structural folding behaviour. This
            includes the detection of shared optimal, suboptimal
            and local secondary structures. Consequently, our
            distance measure avoids falling into the trap of
            fixing specific structures. A pairwise comparison
            strategy in a set of multiple RNAs leads us to
            construct a network of structural relationships
            using the neighbour joining method.  Attempts to
            predict phylogenetic trees are discussed and
            demonstrated by means of viral RNAs.}
