abstract = {MOTIVATION: Prochlorococcus possesses the smallest genome 
            of all sequenced photoautotrophs. Although the number of 
            regulatory proteins in the genome is very small, the 
            relative number of small regulatory RNAs is comparable with 
            that of other bacteria. The compact genome size of 
            Prochlorococcus offers an ideal system to search for targets 
            of small RNAs (sRNAs) and to refine existing target 
            prediction algorithms. RESULTS: Target predictions for the 
            cyanobacterial sRNA Yfr1 were carried out with INTARNA in 
            Prochlorococcus MED4. The ultraconserved Yfr1 sequence motif 
            was defined as the putative interaction seed. To study the 
            impact of Yfr1 on its predicted mRNA targets, a reporter 
            system based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) was applied. 
            We show that Yfr1 inhibits the translation of two predicted 
            targets. We used mutation analysis to confirm that Yfr1 
            directly regulates its targets by an antisense interaction 
            sequestering the ribosome binding site, and to assess the 
            importance of interaction site accessibility.}
