abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important and essential 
            roles in eukaryotic gene expression regulating splicing, 
            localization, translation, and stability of mRNAs. We 
            describe ultraviolet crosslinking and affinity purification 
            (uvCLAP), an easy-to-use, robust, reproducible, and 
            high-throughput method to determine in vivo targets of RBPs. 
            uvCLAP is fast and does not rely on radioactive labeling of 
            RNA. We investigate binding of 15 RBPs from fly, mouse, and 
            human cells to test the method's performance and 
            applicability. Multiplexing of signal and control libraries 
            enables straightforward comparison of samples. Experiments 
            for most proteins achieve high enrichment of signal over 
            background. A point mutation and a natural splice isoform 
            that change the RBP subcellular localization dramatically 
            alter target selection without changing the targeted RNA 
            motif, showing that compartmentalization of RBPs can be used 
            as an elegant means to generate RNA target specificity.}
