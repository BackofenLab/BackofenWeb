abstract = {The function of non-coding RNA genes largely depends on 
            their secondary structure and the interaction with other 
            molecules. Thus, an accurate prediction of secondary 
            structure and RNA-RNA interaction is essential for the 
            understanding of biological roles and pathways associated 
            with a specific RNA gene. We present web servers to analyze 
            multiple RNA sequences for common RNA structure and for RNA 
            interaction sites. The web servers are based on the recent 
            PET (Probabilistic Evolutionary and Thermodynamic) models 
            PETfold and PETcofold, but add user friendly features 
            ranging from a graphical layer to interactive usage of the 
            predictors. Additionally, the web servers provide direct 
            access to annotated RNA alignments, such as the Rfam 10.0 
            database and multiple alignments of 16 vertebrate genomes 
            with human. The web servers are freely available at:
