abstract = {MOTIVATION: The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune 
            system in many archaea and bacteria, which provides 
            resistance against invading genetic elements. The first 
            phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity is called adaptation, in which 
            small DNA fragments are excised from genetic elements and 
            are inserted into a CRISPR array generally adjacent to its 
            so called leader sequence at one end of the array. It has 
            been shown that transcription initiation and adaptation 
            signals of the CRISPR array are located within the leader. 
            However, apart from promoters, there is very little 
            knowledge of sequence or structural motifs or their possible 
            functions. Leader properties have mainly been characterized 
            through transcriptional initiation data from single 
            organisms but large-scale characterization of leaders has 
            remained challenging due to their low level of sequence 
            conservation. RESULTS: We developed a method to successfully 
            detect leader sequences by focusing on the consensus repeat 
            of the adjacent CRISPR array and weak upstream conservation 
            signals. We applied our tool to the analysis of a 
            comprehensive genomic database and identified several 
            characteristic properties of leader sequences specific to 
            archaea and bacteria, ranging from distinctive sizes to 
            preferential indel localization. CRISPRleader provides a 
            full annotation of the CRISPR array, its strand orientation 
            as well as conserved core leader boundaries that can be 
            uploaded to any genome browser. In addition, it outputs 
            reader-friendly HTML pages for conserved leader clusters 
            from our database. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: 
            CRISPRleader and multiple sequence alignments for all 195 
            leader clusters are available at
