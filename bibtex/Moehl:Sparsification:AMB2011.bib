abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Although many RNA molecules contain 
            pseudoknots, computational prediction of pseudoknotted RNA 
            structure is still in its infancy due to high running time 
            and space consumption implied by the dynamic programming 
            formulations of the problem. RESULTS: We introduce 
            sparsification to significantly speedup the dynamic 
            programming approaches for pseudoknotted RNA structure 
            prediction, which also lower the space requirements. 
            Although sparsification has been applied to a number of 
            RNA-related structure prediction problems in the past few 
            years, we provide the first application of sparsification to 
            pseudoknotted RNA structure prediction specifically and to 
            handling gapped fragments more generally - which has a much 
            more complex recursive structure than other problems to 
            which sparsification has been applied. We analyse how to 
            sparsify four pseudoknot structure prediction algorithms, 
            among those the most general method available (the 
            Rivas-Eddy algorithm) and the fastest one (Reeder-Giegerich 
            algorithm). In all algorithms the number of "candidate" 
            substructures to be considered is reduced. CONCLUSION: 
            Experimental results on the sparsified Reeder-Giegerich 
            algorithm suggest a linear speedup over the unsparsified 
            implementation.}
