abstract = {Motivation: RNA sequence design is studied at least as long as
            the classical folding problem. While for the latter the functional fold
            of an RNA molecule is to be found, inverse folding tries to identify
            RNA sequences that fold into a function-specific target structure. In
            combination with RNA-based biotechnology and synthetic biology,
            reliable RNA sequence design becomes a crucial step to generate
            novel biochemical components.
            Results: In this article, the computational tool antaRNA is presented.
            It is capable of compiling RNA sequences for a given structure
            that comply in addition with an adjustable full range objective GCcontent
            distribution, specific sequence constraints and additional
            fuzzy structure constraints. antaRNA applies ant colony optimization
            meta-heuristics and its superior performance is shown on a biological
            datasets.
