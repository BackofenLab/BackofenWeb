abstract = {The protein structure prediction problem is one of
            the most studied problems in Computational
            Biology. It can be reasonably abstracted as a
            minimization problem. The function to be minimized
            depends on the distances between the various
            amino-acids composing the protein and on their
            types. Even with strong approximations, the problem
            is shown to be computationally intractable. However,
            the solution of the problem for an arbitrary input
            size is not needed. Solutions for proteins of length
            100-200 would give a strong contribution to
            Biotechnology. In this paper, we tackle the problem
            with constraint-based methods, using additional
            constraints and heuristics coming from the secondary
            structure of a protein that can be quickly predicted
            with acceptable approximation. Our prototypic
            implementation is written using constraints over
            finite domains in the Mozart programming system. It
            improves over any previous constraint-based approach
            and shows the power and flexibility of the
            method. Especially, it is well suited for further
            extensions.}
