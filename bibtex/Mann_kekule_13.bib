abstract = {A standard representation of molecules is based on graphs where atoms
            correspond to vertices and covalent bonds are represented by a number of edges
            according to the bond order. This depiction reaches its limitations for aromatic
            molecules where the aromatic ring can be encoded by different bond order
            layouts, i.e. Kekule structures, since electrons are shared within the ring rather
            than fixed to a specific bond. Thus, several Kekule structures are possible for
            aromatic molecules. Here, we propose a new constraint programming based approach
            to enumerate all Kekule structures for a given molecule. Furthermore, the
            ambiguity information derived is used to enable a unique Kekule-based SMILES encoding of
            the molecule independent of any aromaticity detection algorithm. This is of
            importance, since there is no generally accepted aromaticity definition
            available that covers all cases.}
