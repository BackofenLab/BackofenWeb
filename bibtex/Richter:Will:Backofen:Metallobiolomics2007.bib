abstract = {The folding of biopolymers is crucially determined by the
            properties and the topology of the underlying energy landscape.
            A reduced representation of these energy landscapes is provided
            by barrier trees, which can be used to study the dynamical
            behavior of the folding. We presented a generic,
            problem-independent approach for the generation of barrier
            trees of discrete biopolymer models. In contrast to previous
            studies, the approach used does not rely on enumeration,
            which is limited to smaller molecules due to the amount of
            available memory. The algorithm has been applied to RNA and a
            lattice protein. The results show that the approach can be used
            to compute both all local minima and the exact barrier tree of
            an energy landscape. The presented method does not restrict the
            investigated conformation space to certain regions.}
