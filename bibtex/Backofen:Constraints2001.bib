abstract = {The protein structure prediction problem is one of the most
            (if not the most) important problem in computational biology. This
            problem consists of finding the conformation of a protein with
            minimal energy. Because of the complexity of this problem, simplified
            models like Dill's HP-lattice model [15], [16] have become a major
            tool for investigating general properties of protein folding. Even
            for this simplified model, the structure prediction problem has been
            shown to be NP-complete [5], [7]. We describe a constraint
            formulation of the HP-model structure prediction problem, and present
            the basic constraints and search strategy. Of course, the simple
            formulation would not lead to an efficient algorithm. We therefore
            describe redundant constraints to prune the search tree. Furthermore,
            we need bounding function for the energy of an HP-protein. We
            introduce a new lower bound based on partial knowledge about the
            final conformation (namely the distribution of H-monomers to layers).
