abstract = {Transposable elements are viewed as 'selfish genetic 
            elements', yet they contribute to gene regulation and genome 
            evolution in diverse ways. More than half of the human 
            genome consists of transposable elements. Alu elements 
            belong to the short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) 
            family of repetitive elements, and with over 1 million 
            insertions they make up more than 10% of the human genome. 
            Despite their abundance and the potential evolutionary 
            advantages they confer, Alu elements can be mutagenic to the 
            host as they can act as splice acceptors, inhibit 
            translation of mRNAs and cause genomic instability. Alu 
            elements are the main targets of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR 
            and the formation of Alu exons is suppressed by the nuclear 
            ribonucleoprotein HNRNPC, but the broad effect of massive 
            secondary structures formed by inverted-repeat Alu elements 
            on RNA processing in the nucleus remains unknown. Here we 
            show that DHX9, an abundant nuclear RNA helicase, binds 
            specifically to inverted-repeat Alu elements that are 
            transcribed as parts of genes. Loss of DHX9 leads to an 
            increase in the number of circular-RNA-producing genes and 
            amount of circular RNAs, translational repression of 
            reporters containing inverted-repeat Alu elements, and 
            transcriptional rewiring (the creation of mostly nonsensical 
            novel connections between exons) of susceptible loci. 
            Biochemical purifications of DHX9 identify the 
            interferon-inducible isoform of ADAR (p150), but not the 
            constitutively expressed ADAR isoform (p110), as an 
            RNA-independent interaction partner. Co-depletion of ADAR 
            and DHX9 augments the double-stranded RNA accumulation 
            defects, leading to increased circular RNA production, 
            revealing a functional link between these two enzymes. Our 
            work uncovers an evolutionarily conserved function of DHX9. 
            We propose that it acts as a nuclear RNA resolvase that 
            neutralizes the immediate threat posed by transposon 
            insertions and allows these elements to evolve as tools for 
            the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.}
