abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Many regulatory non-coding RNAs 
            (ncRNAs) function through complementary binding with mRNAs 
            or other ncRNAs, e.g., microRNAs, snoRNAs and bacterial 
            sRNAs. Predicting these RNA interactions is essential for 
            functional studies of putative ncRNAs or for the design of 
            artificial RNAs. Many ncRNAs show clear signs of undergoing 
            compensating base changes over evolutionary time. Here, we 
            postulate that a non-negligible part of the existing RNA-RNA 
            interactions contain preserved but covarying patterns of 
            interactions. METHODS: We present a novel method that takes 
            compensating base changes across the binding sites into 
            account. The algorithm works in two steps on two 
            pre-generated multiple alignments. In the first step, 
            individual base pairs with high reliability are found using 
            the PETfold algorithm, which includes evolutionary and 
            thermodynamic properties. In step two (where high 
            reliability base pairs from step one are constrained as 
            unpaired), the principle of cofolding is combined with 
            hierarchical folding. The final prediction of intra- and 
            inter-molecular base pairs consists of the reliabilities 
            computed from the constrained expected accuracy scoring, 
            which is an extended version of that used for individual 
            multiple alignments. RESULTS: We derived a rather extensive 
            algorithm. One of the advantages of our approach (in 
            contrast to other RNA-RNA interaction prediction methods) is 
            the application of covariance detection and prediction of 
            pseudoknots between intra- and inter-molecular base pairs. 
            As a proof of concept, we show an example and discuss the 
            strengths and weaknesses of the approach.}
