abstract = {sRNAs (small non-coding RNAs) representing important 
            players in many cellular and regulatory processes have been 
            identified in all three domains of life. In Eukarya and 
            Bacteria, functions have been assigned for many sRNAs, 
            whereas the sRNA populations in Archaea are considerably 
            less well characterized. Recent analyses on a genome-wide 
            scale particularly using high-throughput sequencing 
            techniques demonstrated the presence of high numbers of sRNA 
            candidates in several archaea. However, elucidation of the 
            molecular mechanism of sRNA action, as well as understanding 
            their physiological roles, is in general still challenging, 
            particularly in Archaea, since efficient genetic tools are 
            missing. The identification of cellular targets of 
            identified archaeal sRNAs by experimental approaches or 
            computational prediction programs has begun only recently. 
            At present, targets have been identified for one archaeal 
            sRNA, sRNA162 in Methanosarcina mazei, which interacts with 
            the 5' region of its targets, a cis-encoded and a 
            trans-encoded target, blurring the paradigm of a border 
            between cis- and trans-encoded sRNAs. Besides, the first 
            experimental implications have been obtained in Haloarchaea 
            and Pyrobaculum that archaeal sRNAs also target 3' regions 
            of mRNAs. The present review summarizes our current 
            knowledge on archaeal sRNAs and their biological functions 
            and targets.}
