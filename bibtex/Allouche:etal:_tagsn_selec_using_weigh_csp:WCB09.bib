abstract = {In recent a paper [5], we have proposed a new method
            called "Russian Doll Search with Tree Decomposition"
            to improve optimization in weighted CSP
            frameworks. This approach is based on identifying
            conditionally independent subproblems, which are
            solved independently and whose optimum is cached, in
            the Branch and Bound algorithm. The central idea was
            to (inductively) solve a relaxation of each
            subproblem to strengthen bounds in order to overcome
            weakness associated to the locality of bounds
            induced by decomposition, which often hampers the
            practical effects of this result, because
            subproblems are often uselessly solved to
            optimality. The algorithm obtained, BTD-RDS,
            generalizes both RDS and treedecomposition based
            algorithms such as BTD or AND-OR Branch and
            Bound. Experimentation have been done on the one
            hand on CELAR benchmark [1], closing a very hard
            frequency assignment instance which has been open
            for more than 10 years and on the other hand on a
            new benchmark from bioinformatic field: the tagsnp
            selection. ...}
