abstract = {Computational methods for determining the secondary 
            structure of RNA sequences from given alignments are 
            currently either based on thermodynamic folding, 
            compensatory base pair substitutions or both. However, there 
            is currently no approach that combines both sources of 
            information in a single optimization problem. Here, we 
            present a model that formally integrates both the 
            energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the 
            folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have 
            implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies 
            base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved 
            and of being energetically favorable. The consensus 
            structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy 
            scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly 
            predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the 
            probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA 
            structure prediction than the corresponding probability of 
            being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that 
            structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by 
            folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) 
            may also benefit from employing the principles of the model 
            we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a 
            set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance 
            compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.}
