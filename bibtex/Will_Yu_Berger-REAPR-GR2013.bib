abstract = {Recent genome-wide computational screens that search for 
            conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole genome 
            alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of structural 
            noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity of such approaches, 
            however, is limited due to their reliance on sequence-based 
            whole-genome aligners, which regularly misalign structural 
            ncRNAs. This suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may 
            remain undetected. Structure-based alignment, which could 
            increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for 
            genome-wide screens due to its extreme computational costs. 
            Breaking this barrier, we present the pipeline REAPR 
            (RE-Alignment for Prediction of structural ncRNA), which 
            efficiently realigns whole genomes based on RNA sequence and 
            structure, thus allowing us to boost the performance of de 
            novo ncRNA predictors, such as RNAz. Key to the pipeline's 
            efficiency is the development of a novel banding technique 
            for multiple RNA alignment. REAPR significantly outperforms 
            the widely-used predictors RNAz and EvoFold in genome-wide 
            screens; in direct comparison to the most recent RNAz screen 
            on D. melanogaster, REAPR predicts twice as many 
            high-confidence ncRNA candidates. Moreover, modEncode 
            RNA-Seq experiments confirm a substantial number of its 
            predictions as transcripts. REAPR's advancement of de novo 
            structural characterization of ncRNAs complements the 
            identification of transcripts from rapidly accumulating 
            RNA-Seq data.}
