abstract = {A lack of cell surface markers for the specific 
            identification, isolation and subsequent analysis of living 
            prostate tumor cells hampers progress in the field. Specific 
            characterization of tumor cells and their microenvironment 
            in a multi-parameter molecular assay could significantly 
            improve prognostic accuracy for the heterogeneous prostate 
            tumor tissue. Novel functionalized gold-nano particles allow 
            fluorescence-based detection of absolute mRNA expression 
            levels in living cells by fluorescent activated flow 
            cytometry (FACS). We use of this technique to separate 
            prostate tumor and benign cells in human prostate needle 
            biopsies based on the expression levels of the tumor marker 
            alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). We combined RNA and 
            protein detection of living cells by FACS to gate for 
            epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) positive tumor and 
            benign cells, EPCAM/CD45 double negative mesenchymal cells 
            and CD45 positive infiltrating lymphocytes. EPCAM positive 
            epithelial cells were further sub-gated into AMACR high and 
            low expressing cells. Two hundred cells from each population 
            and several biopsies from the same patient were analyzed 
            using a multiplexed gene expression profile to generate a 
            cell type resolved profile of the specimen. This technique 
            provides the basis for the clinical evaluation of cell type 
            resolved gene expression profiles as pre-therapeutic 
            prognostic markers for prostate cancer.}
