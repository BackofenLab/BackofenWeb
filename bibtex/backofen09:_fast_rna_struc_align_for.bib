abstract = {The complexity of pairwise RNA structure alignment
            depends on the structural restrictions assumed for
            both the input structures and the computed consensus
            structure. For arbitrarily crossing input and
            consensus structures, the problem is NP-hard. For
            non-crossing consensus structures, Jiang et al's
            algorithm [1] computes the alignment in O(n^2 m^2 ) time
            where n and m denote the lengths of the two input
            sequences. If also the input structures are
            non-crossing, the problem n corresponds to tree
            editing which can be solved in O(m^2 n(1 + log n/m ))
            time [2]. We present a new algorithm that solves the
            problem for dcrossing structures in O(dm^2 n log n)
            time, where d is a parameter that is one for
            non-crossing structures, bounded by n for crossing
            structures, and much smaller than n on most practical
            examples. Crossing input structures allow for
            applications where the input is not a fixed structure
            but is given as base-pair probability
            matrices. Keywords : RNA, sequence structure alignment,
            simultaneous alignment and folding}
