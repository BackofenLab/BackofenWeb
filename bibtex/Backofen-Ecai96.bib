abstract = {There have been two different methods for checking the satisfiability of
            feature descriptions using the functional uncertainty device,
            namely [Kaplan/Maxwell88] and [Backofen94]. Although only the one
            in "http://www.tcs.informatik.uni-muenchen.de/~backofen/abstracts.html#RegularPathExprJSC94.abstract"
            solves the satisfiability problem completely, both methods have their
            merits. But it may happen that in one single 
            description, there are parts where the first method is more
            appropriate, and other parts 
            where the second should be applied. In this paper, we present a
            common framework that allows to combine both methods. 
            This is done be presented a set of rules for simplifying feature descriptions.
            The different methods are described as different controls on
            this rule set, where a control specifies in which order the different
            rules must be applied.
