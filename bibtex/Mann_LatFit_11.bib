  abstract= 	 {Background: Lattice models are a common abstraction used in the
study of protein structures and related topics.
Various approaches to the protein chain lattice fitting problem have
been suggested but only one tool is currently openly available and this is for
backbone-only models.
  
Results: We introduce LatFit, a new tool to produce high
accuracy lattice protein models from protein atomic co-ordinates. It generates
backbone-only models as well as lattice models including side chains in various
lattice types. LatFit implements a new dRMSD-optimisation fitting procedure
in addition to a known cRMSD-optimising method. 
The program is freely available for download or as a web server at
http://cpsp.informatik.uni-freiburg.de
Conclusions: We model a large non-redundant set of high resolution
proteins (SCOP database) on three commonly used lattices: 3D cubic (100), face
centred cubic (FCC, 110), and knight's walk (210). Both backbone and side chain
models produced by LatFit show low deviation from the original data (e.g.
1.5A RMSD in FCC lattice). To our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive study of lattice quality for on-lattice protein models including
side chains.},
