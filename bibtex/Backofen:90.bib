abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of the programming
            language PC-Life. This language integrates the functional and the
            logic-oriented programming style and feature types supporting
            inheritance.  This combination yields a language particularly, suited to
            knowledge representation, especially for application in computational
            linguistics.
