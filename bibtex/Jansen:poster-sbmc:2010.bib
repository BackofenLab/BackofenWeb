abstract = {Introduction:
            Cholesterol and other lipids play an important role in the genesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Lipids are transported in bloodstream by lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are heterogeneous and consist of a dominant lipid part and a small protein part. The most common and referenced method to classify lipoproteins is by density. High density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) are of great interest in lipid research. However, lipoprotein analysis is elaborate and expensive. A model predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease depending on the lipid metabolism may be of great benefit. 
            Methods:
            Here, we present a refined version of a previously described model of the human lipoprotein metabolism. The model describes the behaviour of particular lipoproteins dependent on a set of reaction rates. Due to the large number of possible lipoprotein compositions, the computation is done by the stochastic Gillespie algorithm. The now presented model is based on a dataset of lipoprotein measurements (circa 2000 patients) and contains several changes and refinements to the prior approach.
            Results:
            Our model is able to reproduce measured lipid data of humans with normal lipoprotein values. Furthermore, certain lipoprotein-associated diseases like hypercholesterolemia may be simulated by modifying the associated parameters of the metabolism. As particular lipoproteins are simulated, we are able to get information about the distribution and metabolic rates of lipoproteins in all density classes.
            Discussion:
            The model is capable to investigate associated diseases of lipid metabolism and to provide a powerful tool for possible therapeutic approaches. However, there is still need for further improvements.}
