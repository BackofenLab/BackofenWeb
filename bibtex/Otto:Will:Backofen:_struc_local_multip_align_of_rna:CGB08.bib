abstract = {Today, RNA is well known to perform important
            regulatory and catalytical function due to its
            distinguished structure. Consequentially, structure
            is conserved in evolution and state-of-the art RNA
            multiple alignment algorithms consider structure as
            well as sequence information. However, existing
            tools neglect the important aspect of
            locality. Notably, locality in RNA occurs as
            similarity of subsequences as well as similarity of
            only substructures. <p> We present a novel approach
            for multiple alignment of RNAs that deals with both
            kinds of locality. The approach extends LocARNA by
            structural locality and delegates the construction
            of multiple alignments to T-Coffee.  <p> The paper
            systematically investigates structural locality in
            known RNA families. Benchmarking multiple alignment
            tools on structurally local families shows the need
            for algorithmic support of this locality. The
            improvement in accuracy in special cases is achieved
            while staying competitive with state-of-the-art
            alignment tools across the whole Bralibase.  <p>
