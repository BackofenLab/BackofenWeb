abstract = {The unprecedented outbreak of Ebola in West Africa resulted 
            in over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths, underlining the need 
            for a better understanding of the biology of this highly 
            pathogenic virus to develop specific counter strategies. Two 
            filoviruses, the Ebola and Marburg viruses, result in a 
            severe and often fatal infection in humans. However, bats 
            are natural hosts and survive filovirus infections without 
            obvious symptoms. The molecular basis of this striking 
            difference in the response to filovirus infections is not 
            well understood. We report a systematic overview of 
            differentially expressed genes, activity motifs and pathways 
            in human and bat cells infected with the Ebola and Marburg 
            viruses, and we demonstrate that the replication of 
            filoviruses is more rapid in human cells than in bat cells. 
            We also found that the most strongly regulated genes upon 
            filovirus infection are chemokine ligands and transcription 
            factors. We observed a strong induction of the JAK/STAT 
            pathway, of several genes encoding inhibitors of MAP kinases 
            (DUSP genes) and of PPP1R15A, which is involved in ER 
            stress-induced cell death. We used comparative 
            transcriptomics to provide a data resource that can be used 
            to identify cellular responses that might allow bats to 
            survive filovirus infections.}
