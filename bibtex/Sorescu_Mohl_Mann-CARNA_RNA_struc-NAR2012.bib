abstract = {Due to recent algorithmic progress, tools for the gold 
            standard of comparative RNA analysis, namely Sankoff-style 
            simultaneous alignment and folding, are now readily 
            applicable. Such approaches, however, compare RNAs with 
            respect to a simultaneously predicted, single, nested 
            consensus structure. To make multiple alignment of RNAs 
            available in cases, where this limitation of the standard 
            approach is critical, we introduce a web server that 
            provides a complete and convenient interface to the RNA 
            structure alignment tool 'CARNA'. This tool uniquely 
            supports RNAs with multiple conserved structures per RNA and 
            aligns pseudoknots intrinsically; these features are highly 
            desirable for aligning riboswitches, RNAs with conserved 
            folding pathways, or pseudoknots. We represent structural 
            input and output information as base pair probability dot 
            plots; this provides large flexibility in the input, ranging 
            from fixed structures to structure ensembles, and enables 
            immediate visual analysis of the results. In contrast to 
            conventional Sankoff-style approaches, 'CARNA' optimizes all 
            structural similarities in the input simultaneously, for 
            example across an entire RNA structure ensemble. Even 
            compared with already costly Sankoff-style alignment, 
            'CARNA' solves an intrinsically much harder problem by 
            applying advanced, constraint-based, algorithmic techniques. 
            Although 'CARNA' is specialized to the alignment of RNAs 
            with several conserved structures, its performance on RNAs 
            in general is on par with state-of-the-art general-purpose 
            RNA alignment tools, as we show in a Bralibase 2.1 
            benchmark. The web server is freely available at 
            http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CARNA.}
