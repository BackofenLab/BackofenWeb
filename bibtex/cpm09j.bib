abstract = {The complexity of pairwise RNA structure alignment
            depends on the structural restrictions assumed for
            both the input structures and the computed consensus
            structure. For arbitrarily crossing input and
            consensus structures, the problem is NP-hard. For
            non-crossing consensus structures, Jiang et al's
            algorithm [1] computes the alignment in $O(n^2 m^2)$
            time where $n$ and $m$ denote the lengths of the two
            input sequences. If also the input structures are
            non-crossing, the problem corresponds to tree
            editing which can be solved in $O(m^2 n(1 + log n/m
            ))$ time [2]. We present a new algorithm that solves
            the problem for d-crossing structures in $O(dm^2 n
            log n)$ time, where d is a parameter that is one for
            non-crossing structures, bounded by $n$ for crossing
            structures, and much smaller than $n$ on most
            practical examples. Crossing input structures allow
            for applications where the input is not a fixed
            structure but is given as base-pair probability
            matrices. Keywords : RNA, sequence structure
            alignment, simultaneous alignment and folding}
