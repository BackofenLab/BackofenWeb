abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Regulatory antisense RNAs are a class 
            of ncRNAs that regulate gene expression by prohibiting the 
            translation of an mRNA by establishing stable interactions 
            with a target sequence. There is great demand for efficient 
            computational methods to predict the specific interaction 
            between an ncRNA and its target mRNA(s). There are a number 
            of algorithms in the literature which can predict a variety 
            of such interactions - unfortunately at a very high 
            computational cost. Although some existing target prediction 
            approaches are much faster, they are specialized for 
            interactions with a single binding site. METHODS: In this 
            paper we present a novel algorithm to accurately predict the 
            minimum free energy structure of RNA-RNA interaction under 
            the most general type of interactions studied in the 
            literature. Moreover, we introduce a fast heuristic method 
            to predict the specific (multiple) binding sites of two 
            interacting RNAs. RESULTS: We verify the performance of our 
            algorithms for joint structure and binding site prediction 
            on a set of known interacting RNA pairs. Experimental 
            results show our algorithms are highly accurate and 
            outperform all competitive approaches.}
