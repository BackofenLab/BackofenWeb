abstract = {BACKGROUND: snoReport uses RNA secondary structure 
            prediction combined with machine learning as the basis to 
            identify the two main classes of small nucleolar RNAs, the 
            box H/ACA snoRNAs and the box C/D snoRNAs. Here, we present 
            snoReport 2.0, which substantially improves and extends in 
            the original method by: extracting new features for both box 
            C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs; developing a more sophisticated 
            technique in the SVM training phase with recent data from 
            vertebrate organisms and a careful choice of the SVM 
            parameters C and gamma; and using updated versions of tools 
            and databases used for the construction of the original 
            version of snoReport. To validate the new version and to 
            demonstrate its improved performance, we tested snoReport 
            2.0 in different organisms. RESULTS: Results of the training 
            and test phases of boxes H/ACA and C/D snoRNAs, in both 
            versions of snoReport, are discussed. Validation on real 
            data was performed to evaluate the predictions of snoReport 
            2.0. Our program was applied to a set of previously 
            annotated sequences, some of them experimentally confirmed, 
            of humans, nematodes, drosophilids, platypus, chickens and 
            leishmania. We significantly improved the predictions for 
            vertebrates, since the training phase used information of 
            these organisms, but H/ACA box snoRNAs identification was 
            improved for the other ones. CONCLUSION: We presented 
            snoReport 2.0, to predict H/ACA box and C/D box snoRNAs, an 
            efficient method to find true positives and avoid false 
            positives in vertebrate organisms. H/ACA box snoRNA 
            classifier showed an F-score of 93 % (an improvement of 10 % 
            regarding the previous version), while C/D box snoRNA 
            classifier, an F-Score of 94 % (improvement of 14 %). 
            Besides, both classifiers exhibited performance measures 
            above 90 %. These results show that snoReport 2.0 avoid 
            false positives and false negatives, allowing to predict 
            snoRNAs with high quality. In the validation phase, 
            snoReport 2.0 predicted 67.43 % of vertebrate organisms for 
            both classes. For Nematodes and Drosophilids, 69 % and 76.67 
            %, for H/ACA box snoRNAs were predicted, respectively, 
            showing that snoReport 2.0 is good to identify snoRNAs in 
            vertebrates and also H/ACA box snoRNAs in invertebrates 
            organisms.}
