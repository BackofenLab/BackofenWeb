abstract = {In the past years, a large set of new regulatory ncRNAs have
            been identified, but the number of experimentally verified
            targets is considerably low. Thus, computational target
            prediction methods are on high demand. Whereas all previous
            approaches for predicting a general joint structure have a
            complexity of $O(n^6)$ running time and $O(n^4)$ space, a more time
            and space efficient interaction prediction that is able to
            handle complex joint structures is necessary for genome-wide
            target prediction problems. In this paper we show how to reduce
            both the time and space complexity of the RNA-RNA interaction
            prediction problem as described by Alkan et al. via dynamic
            programming sparsification - which allows to discard large
            portions of DP tables without loosing optimality. Applying
            sparsification techniques reduces the complexity of the original
            algorithm from $O(n^6)$ time and $O(n^4)$ space to $O(n^4 \psi(n))$ time
            and $O(n^2 \psi(n) + n^3)$ space for some function $\psi(n)$, which turns
            out to have small values for the range of $n$ that we encounter in
            practice. Under the assumption that the polymer-zeta property
            holds for RNA-structures, we demonstrate that $\psi(n)=O(n)$ on
            average, resulting in a linear time and space complexity
            improvement over the original algorithm. We evaluate our
            sparsified algorithm for RNA-RNA interaction prediction by total
            free energy minimization, based on the energy model of Chitsaz
            et al., on a set of known interactions. Our results confirm
            the significant reduction of time and space requirements in
            practice.}
