abstract = {MOTIVATION: During the last few years, several new small 
            regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) have been discovered in bacteria. 
            Most of them act as post-transcriptional regulators by base 
            pairing to a target mRNA, causing translational repression 
            or activation, or mRNA degradation. Numerous sRNAs have 
            already been identified, but the number of experimentally 
            verified targets is considerably lower. Consequently, 
            computational target prediction is in great demand. Many 
            existing target prediction programs neglect the 
            accessibility of target sites and the existence of a seed, 
            while other approaches are either specialized to certain 
            types of RNAs or too slow for genome-wide searches. RESULTS: 
            We introduce INTARNA, a new general and fast approach to the 
            prediction of RNA-RNA interactions incorporating 
            accessibility of target sites as well as the existence of a 
            user-definable seed. We successfully applied INTARNA to the 
            prediction of bacterial sRNA targets and determined the 
            exact locations of the interactions with a higher accuracy 
            than competing programs. AVAILABILITY:
