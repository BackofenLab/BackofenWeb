abstract = {Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are a class of structural RNAs 
            that often regulate mRNA targets via post-transcriptional 
            base pair interactions. We determined features that 
            discriminate functional from non-functional interactions and 
            assessed the influence of these features on genome-wide 
            target predictions. For this purpose, we compiled a set of 
            71 experimentally verified sRNA-target pairs from 
            Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Furthermore, we 
            collected full-length 5' untranslated regions by using 
            genome-wide experimentally verified transcription start 
            sites. Only interaction sites in sRNAs, but not in targets, 
            show significant sequence conservation. In addition to this 
            observation, we found that the base pairing between sRNAs 
            and their targets is not conserved in general across more 
            distantly related species. A closer inspection of RybB and 
            RyhB sRNAs and their targets revealed that the base pairing 
            complementarity is only conserved in a small subset of the 
            targets. In contrast to conservation, accessibility of 
            functional interaction sites is significantly higher in both 
            sRNAs and targets in comparison to non-functional sites. 
            Based on the above observations, we successfully used the 
            following constraints to improve the specificity of 
            genome-wide target predictions: the region of interaction 
            initiation must be located in (1) highly accessible regions 
            in both interaction partners and (2) unstructured conserved 
            sRNA regions derived from reliability profiles of multiple 
            sRNA alignments. Aligned sequences of homologous sRNAs, 
            functional and non-functional targets, and a supplementary 
            document with supplementary tables, figures and references 
            are available at
