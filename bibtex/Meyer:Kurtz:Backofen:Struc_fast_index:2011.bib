abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The secondary structure of RNA 
            molecules is intimately related to their function and often 
            more conserved than the sequence. Hence, the important task 
            of searching databases for RNAs requires to match 
            sequence-structure patterns. Unfortunately, current tools 
            for this task have, in the best case, a running time that is 
            only linear in the size of sequence databases. Furthermore, 
            established index data structures for fast sequence 
            matching, like suffix trees or arrays, cannot benefit from 
            the complementarity constraints introduced by the secondary 
            structure of RNAs. RESULTS: We present a novel method and 
            readily applicable software for time efficient matching of 
            RNA sequence-structure patterns in sequence databases. Our 
            approach is based on affix arrays, a recently introduced 
            index data structure, preprocessed from the target database. 
            Affix arrays support bidirectional pattern search, which is 
            required for efficiently handling the structural constraints 
            of the pattern. Structural patterns like stem-loops can be 
            matched inside out, such that the loop region is matched 
            first and then the pairing bases on the boundaries are 
            matched consecutively. This allows to exploit base pairing 
            information for search space reduction and leads to an 
            expected running time that is sublinear in the size of the 
            sequence database. The incorporation of a new chaining 
            approach in the search of RNA sequence-structure patterns 
            enables the description of molecules folding into complex 
            secondary structures with multiple ordered patterns. The 
            chaining approach removes spurious matches from the set of 
            intermediate results, in particular of patterns with little 
            specificity. In benchmark experiments on the Rfam database, 
            our method runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than 
            previous methods. CONCLUSIONS: The presented method's 
            sublinear expected running time makes it well suited for RNA 
            sequence-structure pattern matching in large sequence 
            databases. RNA molecules containing several stem-loop 
            substructures can be described by multiple 
            sequence-structure patterns and their matches are 
            efficiently handled by a novel chaining method. Beyond our 
            algorithmic contributions, we provide with Structator a 
            complete and robust open-source software solution for 
            index-based search of RNA sequence-structure patterns. The 
            Structator software is available at
