abstract = {Various feature descriptions are being employed in logic programming
            languages and constrained-based grammar formalisms.  The common notational
            primitive of these descriptions are functional attributes called features.
            The descriptions considered in this paper are the possibly quantified
            first-order formulae obtained from a signature of binary and unary
            predicates called features and sorts, respectively.  We establish a
            first-order theory FT by means of three axiom schemes, show its
            completeness, and construct three elementarily equivalent models.
            
            One of the models consists of so-called feature graphs, a data structure
            common in computational linguistics.  The other two models consist of
            so-called feature trees, a record-like data structure generalizing the
            trees corresponding to first-order terms.
            
            Our completeness proof exhibits a terminating simplification system
            deciding validity and satisfiability of possibly quantified feature
            descriptions.}
