abstract = {Predicting the folding of an RNA sequence, while allow-
            ing general pseudoknots (PK), consists in finding a minimal free-energy
            matching of its n positions. Assuming independently contributing base-
            pairs, the problem can be solved in Θ(n3)-time using a variant of the
            maximal weighted matching. By contrast, the problem was previously
            proven NP-Hard in the more realistic nearest-neighbor energy model.
            In this work, we consider an intermediate model, called the stacking-
            pairs energy model. We extend a result by Lyngsø, showing that RNA
            folding with PK is NP-Hard within a large class of parametrization for
            the model. We also show the approximability of the problem, by giving
            a practical Θ(n3) algorithm that achieves at least a 5-approximation for
            any parametrization of the stacking model. This contrasts nicely with
            the nearest-neighbor version of the problem, which we prove cannot be
            approximated within any positive ratio, unless P = NP. }
