            This  paper  introduces  Lexicalised  Configuration  Grammar  (LCGs),  a  new  declarative  framework  for  natural  language  syntax.  LCG  is  powerful  enough  to  encode  a  large  number  of  existing  grammar  formalisms,  facilitating  their  comparison  from  the  perspective  of  graph  configuration.  Once  a  formalism  has  been  encoded  as  an  LCG,  the  framework  offers  various  means  to  increase  its  expressivity  in  a  controlled  manner;  trading  expressive  power  for  computational  complexity,  this  makes  it  possible  to  model  syntactic  phenomena  in  novel  ways.  Parsing  algorithms  for  LCGs  lend  themselves  to  a  combination  of  chart-based  and  constraint-based  processing  techniques,  allowing  both  to  bring  in  their  strengths.}
