abstract = {The genome of most prokaryotes gives rise to surprisingly 
            complex transcriptomes, comprising not only protein-coding 
            mRNAs, often organized as operons, but also harbors dozens 
            or even hundreds of highly structured small regulatory RNAs 
            and unexpectedly large levels of anti-sense transcripts. 
            Comprehensive surveys of prokaryotic transcriptomes and the 
            need to characterize also their non-coding components is 
            heavily dependent on computational methods and workflows, 
            many of which have been developed or at least adapted 
            specifically for the use with bacterial and archaeal data. 
            This review provides an overview on the state-of-the-art of 
            RNA bioinformatics focusing on applications to prokaryotes.}
