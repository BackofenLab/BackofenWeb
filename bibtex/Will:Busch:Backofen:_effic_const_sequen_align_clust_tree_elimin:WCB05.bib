abstract = {Aligning DNA and protein sequences has become a standard
            mehtod in molecular biology. Often, it is desirable to
            include partial prior knowledge and conditions in an
            alignment. The most common and successful technique for
            efficient alignment algorithms is dynamic programming
            (DP). However, a weakness of DP is that one cannot include
            additional constraints without specifically tailoring a new
            DP algorithm. Here, we discuss a declarative approach that
            is based on constraint techniques and show how it can be
            extended by formulating additional knowledge as
            constraints. We take special care to obtain the efficiency
            of DP for sequence alignment. This is achieved by careful
            modeling and applying proper solving strategies.}
