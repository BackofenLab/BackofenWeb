abstract = {MOTIVATION: The discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems almost 20 
            years ago rapidly changed our perception of the bacterial 
            and archaeal immune systems. CRISPR loci consist of several 
            repetitive DNA sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by 
            stretches of variable length sequences called spacers. This 
            CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into multiple 
            mature RNA species (crRNAs). A single crRNA is integrated 
            into an interference complex, together with 
            CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade 
            invading nucleic acids. Although existing bioinformatics 
            tools can recognize CRISPR loci by their characteristic 
            repeat-spacer architecture, they generally output CRISPR 
            arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine 
            the strand from which crRNAs are processed. Knowledge of the 
            correct orientation is crucial for many tasks, including the 
            classification of CRISPR conservation, the detection of 
            leader regions, the identification of target sites 
            (protospacers) on invading genetic elements and the 
            characterization of protospacer-adjacent motifs. RESULTS: We 
            present a fast and accurate tool to determine the 
            crRNA-encoding strand at CRISPR loci by predicting the 
            correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine 
            learning approach. Both the repeat sequence and mutation 
            information were encoded and processed by an efficient graph 
            kernel to learn higher-order correlations. The model was 
            trained and tested on curated data comprising >4500 CRISPRs 
            and yielded a remarkable performance of 0.95 AUC ROC (area 
            under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic). In 
            addition, we show that accurate orientation information 
            greatly improved detection of conserved repeat sequence 
            families and structure motifs. We integrated CRISPRstrand 
            predictions into our CRISPRmap web server of CRISPR 
            conservation and updated the latter to version 2.0.
