abstract = {INFO-RNA is a fast algorithm for the INverse FOlding of RNA, i.e. 
            for the design of RNA sequences that fold into a given structure. 
            INFO-RNA is based on two key skills: the design of a good 
            initializing sequence by a new dynamic programming procedure 
            and the use of an advanced stochastic local search strategy. }
