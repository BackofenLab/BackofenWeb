abstract = {INFO-RNA is a new web server for designing RNA sequences 
            that fold into a user given secondary structure. 
            Furthermore, constraints on the sequence can be specified, 
            e.g. one can restrict sequence positions to a fixed 
            nucleotide or to a set of nucleotides. Moreover, the user 
            can allow violations of the constraints at some positions, 
            which can be advantageous in complicated cases. The INFO-RNA 
            web server allows biologists to design RNA sequences in an 
            automatic manner. It is clearly and intuitively arranged and 
            easy to use. The procedure is fast, as most applications are 
            completed within seconds and it proceeds better and faster 
            than other existing tools. The INFO-RNA web server is freely 
            available at 
            http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/INFO-RNA/}
