abstract = {To fend off foreign genetic elements, prokaryotes have 
            developed several defense systems. The most recently 
            discovered defense system, CRISPR/Cas, is sequence-specific, 
            adaptive and heritable. The two central components of this 
            system are the Cas proteins and the CRISPR RNA. The latter 
            consists of repeat sequences that are interspersed with 
            spacer sequences. The CRISPR locus is transcribed into a 
            precursor RNA that is subsequently processed into short 
            crRNAs. CRISPR/Cas systems have been identified in bacteria 
            and archaea, and data show that many variations of this 
            system exist. We analyzed the requirements for a successful 
            defense reaction in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax 
            volcanii. Haloferax encodes a CRISPR/Cas system of the I-B 
            subtype, about which very little is known. Analysis of the 
            mature crRNAs revealed that they contain a spacer as their 
            central element, which is preceded by an 
            eight-nucleotide-long 5' handle that originates from the 
            upstream repeat. The repeat sequences have the potential to 
            fold into a minimal stem loop. Sequencing of the crRNA 
            population indicated that not all of the spacers that are 
            encoded by the three CRISPR loci are present in the same 
            abundance. By challenging Haloferax with an invader plasmid, 
            we demonstrated that the interaction of the crRNA with the 
            invader DNA requires a 10-nucleotide-long seed sequence. In 
            addition, we found that not all of the crRNAs from the three 
            CRISPR loci are effective at triggering the degradation of 
            invader plasmids. The interference does not seem to be 
            influenced by the copy number of the invader plasmid.}
