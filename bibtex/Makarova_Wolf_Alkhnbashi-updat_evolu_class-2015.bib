abstract = {The evolution of CRISPR-cas loci, which encode adaptive 
            immune systems in archaea and bacteria, involves rapid 
            changes, in particular numerous rearrangements of the locus 
            architecture and horizontal transfer of complete loci or 
            individual modules. These dynamics complicate 
            straightforward phylogenetic classification, but here we 
            present an approach combining the analysis of signature 
            protein families and features of the architecture of cas 
            loci that unambiguously partitions most CRISPR-cas loci into 
            distinct classes, types and subtypes. The new classification 
            retains the overall structure of the previous version but is 
            expanded to now encompass two classes, five types and 16 
            subtypes. The relative stability of the classification 
            suggests that the most prevalent variants of CRISPR-Cas 
            systems are already known. However, the existence of rare, 
            currently unclassifiable variants implies that additional 
            types and subtypes remain to be characterized.}
