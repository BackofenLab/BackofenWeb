abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing (AS) involving tandem 
            acceptors that are separated by three nucleotides (NAGNAG) 
            is an evolutionarily widespread class of AS, which is well 
            studied in Homo sapiens (human) and Mus musculus (mouse). It 
            has also been shown to be common in the model seed plants 
            Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). In one of the 
            first studies involving sequence-based prediction of AS in 
            plants, we performed a genome-wide identification and 
            characterization of NAGNAG AS in the model plant 
            Physcomitrella patens, a moss. RESULTS: Using Sanger data, 
            we found 295 alternatively used NAGNAG acceptors in P. 
            patens. Using 31 features and training and test datasets of 
            constitutive and alternative NAGNAGs, we trained a 
            classifier to predict the splicing outcome at NAGNAG tandem 
            splice sites (alternative splicing, constitutive at the 
            first acceptor, or constitutive at the second acceptor). Our 
            classifier achieved a balanced specificity and sensitivity 
            of >or= 89%. Subsequently, a classifier trained exclusively 
            on data well supported by transcript evidence was used to 
            make genome-wide predictions of NAGNAG splicing outcomes. By 
            generation of more transcript evidence from a 
            next-generation sequencing platform (Roche 454), we found 
            additional evidence for NAGNAG AS, with altogether 664 
            alternative NAGNAGs being detected in P. patens using all 
            currently available transcript evidence. The 454 data also 
            enabled us to validate the predictions of the classifier, 
            with 64% (80/125) of the well-supported cases of AS being 
            predicted correctly. CONCLUSION: NAGNAG AS is just as common 
            in the moss P. patens as it is in the seed plants A. 
            thaliana and O. sativa (but not conserved on the level of 
            orthologous introns), and can be predicted with high 
            accuracy. The most informative features are the nucleotides 
            in the NAGNAG and in its immediate vicinity, along with the 
            splice sites scores, as found earlier for NAGNAG AS in 
            animals. Our results suggest that the mechanism behind 
            NAGNAG AS in plants is similar to that in animals and is 
            largely dependent on the splice site and its immediate 
            neighborhood.}
