abstract = {The incidences of Legionnaires' disease are increasing year by
            year, with the most recent outbreak currently being reported from the UK.
            This is due to the increase in use of air-conditioning units as well as
            jacuzzis and public saunas. These devices are ideal for the growth of
            amoebae and ciliated protozoa which are the natural hosts for Legionella
            pneumophila, the etiological agent of the disease. When inhaled in the form
            of aerosoles, the bacteria can invade alveolar macrophages in the human
            lung, where they multiply to large numbers before killing their host cells.
            To date only a few well defined virulence factor of L. pneumophila have been
            identified. Consequently, the mechanisms underlaying their pathogenic
            behaviour are also poorly understood. Our goal here is to search for
            potential virulence factors directly involved in infection, and study the
            function of the protein by biochemical and structural biology methods, for
            e.g., gene-mutation studies and X-ray crystallography.}
