abstract = {Motivation:Biological research produces a wealth of
            measured data. Neither it is easy for biologists to
            postulate hypotheses about the behaviour or structure
            of the observed entity because the relevant properties
            measured are not seen in the ocean of
            measurements. Nor it is easy to design machine
            learning algorithms to classify or cluster the data
            items  for the same reason. Algorithms for
            automatically selecting a highly predictive subset of
            the measured features can help to overcome these
            difficulties.Results: We present an efficient feature
            selection strategy which can be applied to arbitrary
            feature selection problems. The core technique is a
            new method for estimating the quality of subsets from
            previously calculated qualities for smaller subsets by
            minimising the mean standard error of estimated values
            with an approach common to support vector
            machines. This method can be integrated in many
            feature subset search algorithms. We have applied it
            with sequential search algorithms and have been able
            to reduce the number of quality calculations for
            finding accurate feature subsets by about $70\%$. We
            show these improvements by applying our approach to
            the problem of finding highly predictive feature
            subsets for transcription factor binding sites.}
