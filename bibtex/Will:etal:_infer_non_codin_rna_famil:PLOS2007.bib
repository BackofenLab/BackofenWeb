abstract = {The RFAM database defines families of ncRNAs by means of
            sequence similarities that are sufficientto establish
            homology. In some cases, such as microRNAs, box H/ACA
            snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs
            that are characterized by structural similarities, and
            typically consist ofmultiple RNA families. Recent advances
            in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics
            have produced very large sets of putative non-coding RNAs
            and regulatory RNA signals. For many ofthem, evidence for
            stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures
            has been derived, and at least approximate models of their
            structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of
            these hypo-thetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established
            families or classes. We present here a structure-based
            clustering approach that is capable of extracting putative
            RNA classesfrom genome-wide surveys for structured RNAs. The
            LocARNA tool implements a novel variant of theSankoff
            algorithm that is sufficiently fast to deal with several
            thousand candidate sequences. The method is also robust
            against false positive predictions, i.e., a contamination of
            the input data with unstructured ornon-conserved
            sequences. We have successfully tested the LocARNA-based
            clustering approach on the sequences of the
            RFAM-seedalignments. Furthermore, we have applied it to a
            previously published set of 3332 predicted structured
            elements in the Ciona intestinalis genomes (Missal et al.,
            Bioinformatics 21(S2), i77-i78). In addition torecovering
            e.g. tRNAs as a structure-based class, the method identifies
            several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA
            candidates, and suggests several novel classes of ncRNAs for
            which to-date norepresentative has been experimentally
            characterized.}
