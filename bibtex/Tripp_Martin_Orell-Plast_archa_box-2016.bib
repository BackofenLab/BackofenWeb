abstract = {Archaeal and eukaryotic organisms contain sets of C/D box 
            s(no)RNAs with guide sequences that determine ribose 
            2'-O-methylation sites of target RNAs. The composition of 
            these C/D box sRNA sets is highly variable between organisms 
            and results in varying RNA modification patterns which are 
            important for ribosomal RNA folding and stability. Little is 
            known about the genomic organization of C/D box sRNA genes 
            in archaea. Here, we aimed to obtain first insights into the 
            biogenesis of these archaeal C/D box sRNAs and analyzed the 
            genetic context of more than 300 archaeal sRNA genes. We 
            found that the majority of these genes do not possess 
            independent promoters but are rather located at positions 
            that allow for co-transcription with neighboring genes and 
            their start or stop codons were frequently incorporated into 
            the conserved boxC and D motifs. The biogenesis of 
            plasmid-encoded C/D box sRNA variants was analyzed in vivo 
            in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. It was found that C/D box sRNA 
            maturation occurs independent of their genetic context and 
            relies solely on the presence of intact RNA kink-turn 
            structures. The observed plasticity of C/D box sRNA 
            biogenesis is suggested to enable their accelerated 
            evolution and, consequently, allow for adjustments of the 
            RNA modification landscape. This article is protected by
