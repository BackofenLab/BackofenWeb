abstract = {Locality is an important and well-studied notion in 
            comparative analysis of biological sequences. Similarly, 
            taking into account affine gap penalties when calculating 
            biological sequence alignments is a well-accepted technique 
            for obtaining better alignments. When dealing with RNA, one 
            has to take into consideration not only sequential features, 
            but also structural features of the inspected molecule. This 
            makes the computation more challenging, and usually 
            prohibits the comparison only to small RNAs. In this paper 
            we introduce two local metrics for comparing RNAs that 
            extend the Smith-Waterman metric and its normalized version 
            used for string comparison. We also present a global RNA 
            alignment algorithm which handles affine gap penalties. Our 
            global algorithm runs in O(m(2)n(1 + lg n/m)) time, while 
            our local algorithms run in O(m(2)n(1 + lg n/m)) and 
            O(n(2)m) time, respectively, where m <or= n are the lengths 
            of the two given RNAs. These time complexities are 
            comparable to the time complexity of any known RNA alignment 
            algorithm. Furthermore, both our global and local algorithms 
            are robust to selections of arbitrary scoring schemes.}
