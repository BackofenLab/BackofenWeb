abstract = {We present a global search technique for finding the
            minimal conformation of a sequence in Dill's
            HP-lattice model~[Lau:89a,Lau:90a]. The HP-lattice
            model is a simplified model of proteins, that has
            become a major tool for investigating general
            properties of protein folding. The search technique
            uses constraint programming for efficiently pruning
            the search tree. We state the problem of structure
            prediction in the HP-lattice model and describe our
            implementation using the Oz-system.}
