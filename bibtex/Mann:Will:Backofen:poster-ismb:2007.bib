abstract = {Sequence design is a neccessary tool for the investigation of 
            sequence-structure relations. Insights into such fundamental properties will 
            aid to understand protein folding, their evolution, and drug design.
            The HP-model by Lau and Dill mimics globular water-soluble 
            proteins. It is lattice based and focuses on hydrophobic forces. Even in this 
            coarse-grained model, structure prediction and sequence design is 
            NP-complete. Nevertheless, Backofen and Will 
            introduced a Constraint-based Protein Structure Prediction (CPSP) 
            approach that allows the enumeration of 
            all optimal structures.
            HPdesign uses the CPSP approach to solve the inverse folding problem for 
            three-dimensional lattices. Here, a sequence X is searched that 
            adopts a given structure S as its single optimal one. }
