abstract = {In this paper we describe an interface between typed feature formalisms and terminological languages like KL-ONE.  The definition of such
            an interface is motivated by the needs of natural language front-ends to AI-systems where information must be transmitted from the front-
            end to the back-end system and vice versa.
            <P>
            We show how some minor extensions to the feature formalism allow for a
            syntactic description of individual concepts in terms of typed feature structures.  Namely, we propose to include intervals and a special
            kind of sets.  Partial consistency checks can be made on these concept descriptions during the unification of feature terms.  Type checki
            ng on these special types involves calling the classifier of the terminological language.  The final consistency check is performed only w
            hen transferring these concept descriptions into structures of the A-Box of the terminological language.}
