abstract = {Tissue-specific alternative splicing is critical for the 
            emergence of tissue identity during development, yet the 
            role of this process in malignant transformation is 
            undefined. Tissue-specific splicing involves evolutionarily 
            conserved, alternative exons that represent only a minority 
            of the total alternative exons identified. Many of these 
            conserved exons have functional features that influence 
            signaling pathways to profound biological effect. Here, we 
            determined that lineage-specific splicing of a 
            brain-enriched cassette exon in the membrane-binding tumor 
            suppressor annexin A7 (ANXA7) diminishes endosomal targeting 
            of the EGFR oncoprotein, consequently enhancing EGFR 
            signaling during brain tumor progression. ANXA7 exon 
            splicing was mediated by the ribonucleoprotein PTBP1, which 
            is normally repressed during neuronal development. PTBP1 was 
            highly expressed in glioblastomas due to loss of a 
            brain-enriched microRNA (miR-124) and to PTBP1 
            amplification. The alternative ANXA7 splicing trait was 
            present in precursor cells, suggesting that glioblastoma 
            cells inherit the trait from a potential tumor-initiating 
            ancestor and that these cells exploit this trait through 
            accumulation of mutations that enhance EGFR signaling. Our 
            data illustrate that lineage-specific splicing of a 
            tissue-regulated alternative exon in a constituent of an 
            oncogenic pathway eliminates tumor suppressor functions and 
            promotes glioblastoma progression. This paradigm may offer a 
            general model as to how tissue-specific regulatory 
            mechanisms can reprogram normal developmental processes into 
            oncogenic ones.}
