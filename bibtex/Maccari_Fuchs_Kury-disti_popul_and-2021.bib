abstract = {The identification and characterization of rare immune cell 
            populations in humans can be facilitated by their growth 
            advantage in the context of specific genetic diseases. Here, 
            we use autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome to identify a 
            population of FAS-controlled TCRalphabeta+ T cells. They 
            include CD4+, CD8+, and double-negative T cells and can be 
            defined by a CD38+CD45RA+T-BET- expression pattern. These 
            unconventional T cells are present in healthy individuals, 
            are generated before birth, are enriched in lymphoid tissue, 
            and do not expand during acute viral infection. They are 
            characterized by a unique molecular signature that is 
            unambiguously different from other known T cell 
            differentiation subsets and independent of CD4 or CD8 
            expression. Functionally, FAS-controlled T cells represent 
            highly proliferative, noncytotoxic T cells with an IL-10 
            cytokine bias. Mechanistically, regulation of this 
            physiological population is mediated by FAS and CTLA4 
            signaling, and its survival is enhanced by mTOR and STAT3 
            signals. Genetic alterations in these pathways result in 
            expansion of FAS-controlled T cells, which can cause 
            significant lymphoproliferative disease.}
