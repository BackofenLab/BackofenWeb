abstract = {MOTIVATION: The goal of present -omics sciences is to 
            understand biological systems as a whole in terms of 
            interactions of the individual cellular components. One of 
            the main building blocks in this field of study is 
            proteomics where tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in 
            combination with isotopic labelling techniques provides a 
            common way to obtain a direct insight into regulation at the 
            protein level. Methods to identify and quantify the peptides 
            contained in a sample are well established, and their output 
            usually results in lists of identified proteins and 
            calculated relative abundance values. The next step is to 
            move ahead from these abstract lists and apply statistical 
            inference methods to compare measurements, to identify genes 
            that are significantly up- or down-regulated, or to detect 
            clusters of proteins with similar expression profiles. 
            RESULTS: We introduce the Rich Internet Application (RIA) 
            Qupe providing comprehensive data management and analysis 
            functions for LC-MS/MS experiments. Starting with the import 
            of mass spectra data the system guides the experimenter 
            through the process of protein identification by database 
            search, the calculation of protein abundance ratios, and in 
            particular, the statistical evaluation of the quantification 
            results including multivariate analysis methods such as 
            analysis of variance or hierarchical cluster analysis. While 
            a data model to store these results has been developed, a 
            well-defined programming interface facilitates the 
            integration of novel approaches. A compute cluster is 
            utilized to distribute computationally intensive 
            calculations, and a web service allows to interchange 
            information with other -omics software applications. To 
            demonstrate that Qupe represents a step forward in 
            quantitative proteomics analysis an application study on 
            Corynebacterium glutamicum has been carried out. 
            Availability and Implementation: Qupe is implemented in Java 
            utilizing Hibernate, Echo2, R and the Spring framework. We 
            encourage the usage of the RIA in the sense of the 'software 
            as a service' concept, maintained on our servers and 
            accessible at the following location:
