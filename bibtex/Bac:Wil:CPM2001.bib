abstract = {Lattice protein models are used for hierarchical
            approaches to protein structure prediction, as well
            as for investigating principles of protein
            folding. The problem is that there is so far no
            known lattice that can model real protein
            conformations with good quality, \emph{and} for
            which there is an efficient method to prove whether
            a conformation found by some heuristic algorithm is
            optimal. We present such a method for the
            FCC-HP-Model [Agarwala et al., JCB 97]. For the
            FCC-HP-Model, we need to find conformations with a
            maximally compact hydrophobic core. Our method
            allows us to enumerate maximally compact hydrophobic
            cores for sufficiently great number of hydrophobic
            amino-acids. We have used our method to prove the
            optimality of heuristically predicted structures for
            HP-sequences in the FCC-HP-model.}
