abstract = {In the Semantic Enrichment of the Scientific Literature 
            (SESL) project, researchers from academia and from life 
            science and publishing companies collaborated in a 
            pre-competitive way to integrate and share information for 
            type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults. This case study 
            exposes benefits from semantic interoperability after 
            integrating the scientific literature with biomedical data 
            resources, such as UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and the 
            Gene Expression Atlas (GXA). We annotated scientific 
            documents in a standardized way, by applying public 
            terminological resources for diseases and proteins, and 
            other text-mining approaches. Eventually, we compared the 
            genetic causes of T2DM across the data resources to 
            demonstrate the benefits from the SESL triple store. Our 
            solution enables publishers to distribute their content with 
            little overhead into remote data infrastructures, such as 
            into any Virtual Knowledge Broker.}
