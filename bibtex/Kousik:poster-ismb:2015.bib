abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are the most essential cellular process in eukaryotes 
            that involve many important biological activities such as signal transduction, 
            maintaining cell polarity etc. Many protein-protein interactions in cellular 
            signaling are mediated by modular protein domains. Peptide recognition modules 
            (PRMs) are an important subcluss of modular protein domains that specifically 
            recognize short linear peptides to mediate various post translational modifications. 
            Computational identification of modular domain-peptide interactions is an open challenge 
            with high relevance. In this study, we applied machine learning approaches to identify the 
            binding specificity of three modular protein domains (i.e. SH2, SH3, and PDZ domains). All 
            models are based on support vector machines with different kernel functions ranging from 
            polynomial, to Gaussian, to advanced graph kernels. In this way, we model non-linear 
            interactions between amino acid residues. Additionally, a powerful semi-supervised technique 
            was used to tackle the data-imbalance problem. We validated our results on manually curated 
            data sets and achieved competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, 
            we developed an interactive and easy-to-use webserver, namely MoDPepInt (Modular Domain-Peptide 
            Interactions), for the prediction of the binding partners for aforementioned modular protein 
            domains. Currently, we offer models for SH2, SH3 and PDZ domains, via the tools SH2PepInt, 
            SH3PepInt and PDZPepInt. More specifically, our server offers predictions for 51 SH2 human 
            domains and 69 SH3 human domains via single domain models, and predictions for 226 PDZ domains 
            across several species, via 43 multi-domain models. MoDPepInt includes the largest number of 
            models and offers a comprehensive domain-peptide prediction system in a single platform}
