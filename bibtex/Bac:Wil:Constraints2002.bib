abstract = {We introduce a new method for excluding symmetries in
            constraint based search. To our knowledge, it is the
            first declarative method that can be applied to {\em
            arbitrary} symmetries. Our method is based on the
            notion of symmetric constraints, which are used in our
            modification of a general constraint based search
            algorithm. The method does not influence the search
            strategy. Furthermore, it can be used with either the
            full set of symmetries, or with an subset of all
            symmetries. 
            
            We proof correctness, completeness and
            symmetry exclusion properties of our method. Then, we
            show how to apply the method in the special case of
            geometric symmetries (rotations and reflections) and
            permutation symmetries. Furthermore, we give results
            from practical applications.}
