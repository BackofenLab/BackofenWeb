abstract = {Alternative splicing at donor or acceptor sites located 
            just a few nucleotides apart is widespread in many species. 
            It results in subtle changes in the transcripts and often in 
            the encoded proteins. Several of these tandem splice events 
            contribute to the repertoire of functionally different 
            proteins, whereas many are neutral or deleterious. 
            Remarkably, some of the functional events are differentially 
            spliced in tissues or developmental stages, whereas others 
            exhibit constant splicing ratios, indicating that function 
            is not always associated with differential splicing. 
            Stochastic splice site selection seems to play a major role 
            in these processes. Here, we review recent progress in 
            understanding functional and evolutionary aspects as well as 
            the mechanism of splicing at short-distance tandem sites.}
