abstract = {PURPOSE: Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in aqueous humor 
            were suggested to have a role in transcellular signaling and 
            may serve as disease biomarkers. The authors adopted 
            next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to further 
            characterize the miRNA profile in single samples of 60 to 80 
            muL human aqueous humor. METHODS: Samples were obtained at 
            the outset of cataract surgery in nine independent, 
            otherwise healthy eyes. Four samples were used to extract 
            RNA and generate sequencing libraries, followed by an 
            adapter-driven amplification step, electrophoretic size 
            selection, sequencing, and data analysis. Five samples were 
            used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) validation of NGS results. 
            Published NGS data on circulating miRNAs in blood were 
            analyzed in comparison. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight 
            miRNAs were consistently detected by NGS in all four 
            samples; an additional 59 miRNAs were present in at least 
            three samples. The aqueous humor miRNA profile shows some 
            overlap with published NGS-derived inventories of 
            circulating miRNAs in blood plasma with high prevalence of 
            human miR-451a, -21, and -16. In contrast to blood, miR-184, 
            -4448, -30a, -29a, -29c, -19a, -30d, -205, -24, -22, and 
            -3074 were detected among the 20 most prevalent miRNAs in 
            aqueous humor. Relative expression patterns of miR-451a, 
            -202, and -144 suggested by NGS were confirmed by qPCR. 
            CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrate the feasibility of miRNA 
            analysis by NGS in small individual aqueous humor samples. 
            Intraocular cells as well as blood plasma contribute to the 
            extracellular aqueous humor miRNome. The data suggest 
            possible roles of miRNA in intraocular cell adhesion and 
            signaling by TGF-beta and Wnt, which are important in 
            intraocular pressure regulation and glaucoma.}
