abstract = {Graph rewrite systems are powerful tools to model and study
            complex problems in various fields of research. Their successful application
            to chemical reaction modelling on a molecular level was shown but
            no appropriate and simple system is available at the moment.
            The presented Graph Grammar Library (GGL) implements a generic
            Double Push Out approach for general graph rewrite systems. The framework
            focuses on a high level of modularity as well as high performance,
            using state-of-the-art algorithms and data structures, and comes with extensive
            documentation. The large GGL chemistry module enables extensive
            and detailed studies of chemical systems. It well meets the requirements
            and abilities envisioned by Yadav et al. (2004) for such chemical
            rewrite systems. Here, molecules are represented as undirected labeled
            graphs while chemical reactions are described by according graph grammar
            rules. Beside the graph transformation, the GGL offers advanced
            cheminformatics algorithms for instance to estimate energies ofmolecules
            or aromaticity perception. These features are illustrated using a set of
            reactions from polyketide chemistry a huge class of natural compounds
            of medical relevance.
            The graph grammar based simulation of chemical reactions offered by
            the GGL is a powerful tool for extensive cheminformatics studies on a
            molecular level. The GGL already provides rewrite rules for all enzymes
