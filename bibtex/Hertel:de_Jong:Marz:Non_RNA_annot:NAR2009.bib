abstract = {A detailed annotation of non-protein coding RNAs is 
            typically missing in initial releases of newly sequenced 
            genomes. Here we report on a comprehensive ncRNA annotation 
            of the genome of Trichoplax adhaerens, the presumably most 
            basal metazoan whose genome has been published to-date. 
            Since blast identified only a small fraction of the 
            best-conserved ncRNAs--in particular rRNAs, tRNAs and some 
            snRNAs--we developed a semi-global dynamic programming tool, 
            GotohScan, to increase the sensitivity of the homology 
            search. It successfully identified the full complement of 
            major and minor spliceosomal snRNAs, the genes for RNase P 
            and MRP RNAs, the SRP RNA, as well as several small 
            nucleolar RNAs. We did not find any microRNA candidates 
            homologous to known eumetazoan sequences. Interestingly, 
            most ncRNAs, including the pol-III transcripts, appear as 
            single-copy genes or with very small copy numbers in the 
            Trichoplax genome.}
