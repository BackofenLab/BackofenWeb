abstract = {Small RNAs (sRNAs) are one of the key players in the post-transcriptional regulation of
            bacterial gene expression. These molecules, together with transcription factors, form
            regulatory networks and greatly influence the bacterial regulatory landscape. Little is
            known concerning sRNAs and their influence on the regulatory machinery in the genus
            Corynebacterium, despite its medical, veterinary and biotechnological importance. We
            integrate sRNAs and their regulatory interactions into the transcriptional regulatory
            networks of six corynebacterial species, covering four human and animal pathogens,
            and integrate this data into the CoryneRegNet database. To this end, we predicted
            sRNAs to regulate 754 genes, including 206 transcription factors, in corynebacterial
            gene regulatory networks. Amongst them, the sRNA Cd-NCTC13129-sRNA-2 is
            predicted to directly regulate ydfH , which indirectly regulates 66 genes, including the
            global regulator glxR in C. diphtheriae . All of the sRNA-enriched regulatory networks of
            the genus Corynebacterium are made publicly available in the newest release of
            CoryneRegNet ( www.exbio.wzw.tum.de/coryneregnet/ ) to aid in providing valuable
            insights and to guide future experiments.}
