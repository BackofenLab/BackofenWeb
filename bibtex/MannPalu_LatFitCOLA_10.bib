abstract = {In this paper we model and implement a Constraint Programming method to refine
            a lattice fitting of a protein structure produced by a greedy search. We show
            that the model is able to provide better quality solutions. The prototype is
            implemented in COLA and it is based on a limited discrepancy approach.
            Finally, some promising extensions based on local search are discussed.}
