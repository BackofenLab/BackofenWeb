abstract = {Studying intra-annual wood formation dynamics provides valuable information on how tree growth and forests are affected by environmental changes and climatic extreme events. This study has the aim to evaluate and to quantify synergetic potentials emerging from a combination of current state of the art techniques used to monitor intra-annual wood formation processes. Norway spruce trees were studied in detail during the growing season 2009 with weekly sampling of microcores, high resolution point-dendrometers and wood anatomical analysis. The combination of the applied techniques allowed us to convert the spatial scales of radial tracheid diameter profiles to seasonal time scales and to synchronize fluctuations in intra-annual cell diameter profiles. This spatiotemporal information was used to validate the recently introduced software MICA (Multiple interval-based curve alignment). In comparison to the conventional approach of averaging profiles of tree ring variables, the MICA aligned profiles exhibit a significantly higher synchronicity of the averaged data points. We also demonstrate two new features in the MICA application that enable to extrapolate spatiotemporal information between intra-annual profiles for the construction of robust mean (consensus) profiles that are representative for the population dynamics. By using a set of complementary techniques in an integrated approach, this study highlights a new methodological framework that can contribute to a better understanding of the environmental control of wood formation during the growing season.}
