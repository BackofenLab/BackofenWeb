abstract = {SUMMARY: MoDPepInt (Modular Domain Peptide Interaction) is 
            a new, easy-to-use webserver for the prediction of binding 
            partners for modular protein domains. Currently we offer 
            models for SH2, SH3 and PDZ domains via the tools SH2PepInt, 
            SH3PepInt and PDZPepInt. More specifically our server offers 
            predictions for 51 SH2 human domains and 69 SH3 human 
            domains via single domain models, and predictions for 226 
            PDZ domains across several species, via 43 multi-domain 
            models. All models are based on support vector machines with 
            different kernel functions ranging from polynomial, to 
            Gaussian, to advanced graph kernels. In this way we model 
            non-linear interactions between amino acid residues. Results 
            were validated on manually curated data sets achieving 
            competitive performance against various state-of-the-art 
            approaches. AVAILABILITY: The MoDPepInt server is available 
            under the URL: http://modpepint.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/
