abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Despite some degeneracy of sequence 
            signals that govern splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, it is 
            an accepted rule that U2-dependent introns exhibit the 3' 
            terminal dinucleotide AG. Intrigued by anecdotal evidence 
            for functional non-AG 3' splice sites, we carried out a 
            human genome-wide screen. RESULTS: We identified TG 
            dinucleotides functioning as alternative 3' splice sites in 
            36 human genes. The TG-derived splice variants were 
            experimentally validated with a success rate of 92%. 
            Interestingly, ratios of alternative splice variants are 
            tissue-specific for several introns. TG splice sites and 
            their flanking intron sequences are substantially conserved 
            between orthologous vertebrate genes, even between human and 
            frog, indicating functional relevance. Remarkably, TG splice 
            sites are exclusively found as alternative 3' splice sites, 
            never as the sole 3' splice site for an intron, and we 
            observed a distance constraint for TG-AG splice site 
            tandems. CONCLUSION: Since TGs splice sites are exclusively 
            found as alternative 3' splice sites, the U2 spliceosome 
            apparently accomplishes perfect specificity for 3' AGs at an 
            early splicing step, but may choose 3' TGs during later 
            steps. Given the tiny fraction of TG 3' splice sites 
            compared to the vast amount of non-viable TGs, cis-acting 
            sequence signals must significantly contribute to splice 
            site definition. Thus, we consider TG-AG 3' splice site 
            tandems as promising subjects for studies on the mechanisms 
            of 3' splice site selection.}
