abstract = {The small RNA AbcR1 regulates the expression of ABC 
            transporters in the plant pathogen Agrobacterium 
            tumefaciens, the plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti, and 
            the human pathogen Brucella abortus. A combination of 
            proteomic and bioinformatic approaches suggested dozens of 
            AbcR1 targets in A. tumefaciens. Several of these newly 
            discovered targets are involved in the uptake of amino 
            acids, their derivatives, and sugars. Among the latter is 
            the periplasmic sugar-binding protein ChvE, a component of 
            the virulence signal transduction system. We examined 16 
            targets and their interaction with AbcR1 in close detail. In 
            addition to the previously described mRNA interaction site 
            of AbcR1 (M1), the CopraRNA program predicted a second 
            functional module (M2) as target-binding site. Both M1 and 
            M2 contain single-stranded anti-SD motifs. Using mutated 
            AbcR1 variants, we systematically tested by band shift 
            experiments, which sRNA region is responsible for mRNA 
            binding and gene regulation. On the target site, we find 
            that AbcR1 interacts with some mRNAs in the translation 
            initiation region and with others far into their coding 
            sequence. Our data show that AbcR1 is a versatile master 
            regulator of nutrient uptake systems in A. tumefaciens and 
            related bacteria.}
