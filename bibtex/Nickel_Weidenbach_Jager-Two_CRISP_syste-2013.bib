abstract = {The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
            repeats (CRISPR) system represents a highly adaptive and 
            heritable defense system against foreign nucleic acids in 
            bacteria and archaea. We analyzed the two CRISPR-Cas systems 
            in Methanosarcina mazei strain Go1. Although belonging to 
            different subtypes (I-B and III-B), the leaders and repeats 
            of both loci are nearly identical. Also, despite many point 
            mutations in each array, a common hairpin motif was 
            identified in the repeats by a bioinformatics analysis and 
            in vitro structural probing. The expression and maturation 
            of CRISPR-derived RNAs (crRNAs) were studied in vitro and in 
            vivo. Both respective potential Cas6b-type endonucleases 
            were purified and their activity tested in vitro. Each 
            protein showed significant activity and could cleave both 
            repeats at the same processing site. Cas6b of subtype III-B, 
            however, was significantly more efficient in its cleavage 
            activity compared with Cas6b of subtype I-B. Northern blot 
            and differential RNaseq analyses were performed to 
            investigate in vivo transcription and maturation of crRNAs, 
            revealing generally very low expression of both systems, 
            whereas significant induction at high NaCl concentrations 
            was observed. crRNAs derived proximal to the leader were 
            generally more abundant than distal ones and in vivo 
            processing sites were clarified for both loci, confirming 
            the previously well-established 8 nt 5' repeat tags. The 
            3'-ends were more diverse, but generally ended in a prefix 
            of the following repeat sequence (3'-tag). The analysis 
            further revealed a 5'-hydroxy and 3'-phosphate termini 
            architecture of small crRNAs specific for cleavage products 
            of Cas6 endonucleases from type I-E and I-F and type III-B.}
