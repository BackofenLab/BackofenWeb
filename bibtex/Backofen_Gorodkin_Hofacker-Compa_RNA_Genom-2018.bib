abstract = {Over the last two decades it has become clear that RNA is 
            much more than just a boring intermediate in protein 
            expression. Ancient RNAs still appear in the core 
            information metabolism and comprise a surprisingly large 
            component in bacterial gene regulation. A common theme with 
            these types of mostly small RNAs is their reliance of 
            conserved secondary structures. Large scale sequencing 
            projects, on the other hand, have profoundly changed our 
            understanding of eukaryotic genomes. Pervasively 
            transcribed, they give rise to a plethora of large and 
            evolutionarily extremely flexible noncoding RNAs that exert 
            a vastly diverse array of molecule functions. In this 
            chapter we provide a-necessarily incomplete-overview of the 
            current state of comparative analysis of noncoding RNAs, 
            emphasizing computational approaches as a means to gain a 
            global picture of the modern RNA world.}
