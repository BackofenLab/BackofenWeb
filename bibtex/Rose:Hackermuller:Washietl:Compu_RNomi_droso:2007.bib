abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent experimental and computational studies 
            have provided overwhelming evidence for a plethora of 
            diverse transcripts that are unrelated to protein-coding 
            genes. One subclass consists of those RNAs that require 
            distinctive secondary structure motifs to exert their 
            biological function and hence exhibit distinctive patterns 
            of sequence conservation characteristic for positive 
            selection on RNA secondary structure.The deep-sequencing of 
            12 drosophilid species coordinated by the NHGRI provides an 
            ideal data set of comparative computational approaches to 
            determine those genomic loci that code for evolutionarily 
            conserved RNA motifs. This class of loci includes the 
            majority of the known small ncRNAs as well as structured RNA 
            motifs in mRNAs. We report here on a genome-wide survey 
            using RNAz. RESULTS: We obtain 16 000 high quality 
            predictions among which we recover the majority of the known 
            ncRNAs. Taking a pessimistically estimated false discovery 
            rate of 40% into account, this implies that at least some 
            ten thousand loci in the Drosophila genome show the 
            hallmarks of stabilizing selection action of RNA structure, 
            and hence are most likely functional at the RNA level. A 
            subset of RNAz predictions overlapping with TRF1 and BRF 
            binding sites [Isogai et al., EMBO J. 26: 79-89 (2007)], 
            which are plausible candidates of Pol III transcripts, have 
            been studied in more detail. Among these sequences we 
            identify several "clusters" of ncRNA candidates with 
            striking structural similarities. CONCLUSION: The 
            statistical evaluation of the RNAz predictions in comparison 
            with a similar analysis of vertebrate genomes [Washietl et 
            al., Nat. Biotech. 23: 1383-1390 (2005)] shows that 
            qualitatively similar fractions of structured RNAs are found 
            in introns, UTRs, and intergenic regions. The intergenic RNA 
            structures, however, are concentrated much more closely 
            around known protein-coding loci, suggesting that flies have 
            significantly smaller complement of independent structured 
            ncRNAs compared to mammals.}
