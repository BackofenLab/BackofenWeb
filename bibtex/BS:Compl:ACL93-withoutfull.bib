abstract = {Various feature descriptions are being employed in
            constrained-based grammar formalisms.
            The common notational primitive of these descriptions
            are functional attributes called features.  The
            descriptions considered in this paper are the possibly
            quantified first-order formulae obtained from a
            signature of features
            and sorts.  We establish a complete first-order
            theory FT by means of three axiom schemes
            and construct three elementarily
            equivalent models.
            <P>
            One of the models consists of so-called feature graphs, a data
            structure common in computational linguistics.  The other two
            models consist of so-called feature trees, a record-like data
            structure generalizing the trees corresponding to
            first-order terms.
            <P>
            Our completeness proof exhibits a terminating simplification
            system deciding validity and satisfiability of possibly
            quantified feature descriptions.}
