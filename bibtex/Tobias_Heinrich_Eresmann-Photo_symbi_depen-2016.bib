abstract = {Photorhabdus luminescens maintains a symbiotic relationship 
            with the nematodes Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and 
            together they infect and kill insect larvae. To maintain 
            this symbiotic relationship, the bacteria must produce an 
            array of secondary metabolites to assist in the development 
            and replication of nematodes. The regulatory mechanisms 
            surrounding production of these compounds are mostly 
            unknown. The global post-transcriptional regulator, Hfq, is 
            widespread in bacteria and performs many functions, one of 
            which is the facilitation of sRNA binding to target mRNAs, 
            with recent research thoroughly exploring its various 
            pleiotropic effects. Here we generate and characterize an 
            hfq deletion mutant and show that in the absence of hfq, the 
            bacteria are no longer able to maintain a healthy symbiosis 
            with nematodes due to the abolishment of the production of 
            all known secondary metabolites. RNAseq led us to produce a 
            second deletion of a known repressor, HexA, in the same 
            strain, which restored both metabolite production and 
            symbiosis. This article is protected by copyright. All
