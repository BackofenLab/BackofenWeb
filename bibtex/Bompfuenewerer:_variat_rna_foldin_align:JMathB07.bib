abstract = {Dynamic programming algorithms solve many standard problems 
            of RNA bioinformatics in polynomial time. In this 
            contribution we discuss a series of variations on these 
            standard methods that implement refined biophysical models, 
            such as a restriction of RNA folding to canonical 
            structures, and an extension of structural alignments to an 
            explicit scoring of stacking propensities. Furthermore, we 
            demonstrate that a local structural alignment can be 
            employed for ncRNA gene finding. In this context we discuss 
            scanning variants for folding and alignment algorithms.}
