abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing often occurs in the coding 
            sequence and alters protein structure and function. It is 
            mainly carried out in two ways: by skipping exons that 
            encode a certain protein feature and by introducing a 
            frameshift that changes the downstream protein sequence. 
            These mechanisms are widespread and well investigated. 
            RESULTS: Here, we propose an additional mechanism of 
            alternative splicing to modulate protein function. This 
            mechanism creates a protein feature by putting together two 
            non-consecutive exons or destroys a feature by inserting an 
            exon in its body. In contrast to other mechanisms, the 
            individual parts of the feature are present in both splice 
            variants but the feature is only functional in the splice 
            form where both parts are merged. We provide evidence for 
            this mechanism by performing a genome-wide search with four 
            protein features: transmembrane helices, phosphorylation and 
            glycosylation sites, and Pfam domains. CONCLUSION: We 
            describe a novel type of event that creates or removes a 
            protein feature by alternative splicing. Current data 
            suggest that these events are rare. Besides the four 
            features investigated here, this mechanism is conceivable 
            for many other protein features, especially for small linear 
            protein motifs. It is important for the characterization of 
            functional differences of two splice forms and should be 
            considered in genome-wide annotation efforts. Furthermore, 
            it offers a novel strategy for ab initio prediction of 
            alternative splice events.}
