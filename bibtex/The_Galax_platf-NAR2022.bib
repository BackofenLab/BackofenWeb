abstract = {Galaxy is a mature, browser accessible workbench for 
            scientific computing. It enables scientists to share, 
            analyze and visualize their own data, with minimal technical 
            impediments. A thriving global community continues to use, 
            maintain and contribute to the project, with support from 
            multiple national infrastructure providers that enable 
            freely accessible analysis and training services. The Galaxy 
            Training Network supports free, self-directed, virtual 
            training with >230 integrated tutorials. Project engagement 
            metrics have continued to grow over the last 2 years, 
            including source code contributions, publications, software 
            packages wrapped as tools, registered users and their daily 
            analysis jobs, and new independent specialized servers. Key 
            Galaxy technical developments include an improved user 
            interface for launching large-scale analyses with many 
            files, interactive tools for exploratory data analysis, and 
            a complete suite of machine learning tools. Important 
            scientific developments enabled by Galaxy include Vertebrate 
            Genome Project (VGP) assembly workflows and global 
            SARS-CoV-2 collaborations.}
