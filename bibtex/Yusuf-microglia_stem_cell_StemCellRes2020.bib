abstract = {Microglia are resident tissue macrophages of the central nervous
            system (CNS) that arise from erythromyeloid progenitors during
            embryonic development. They play essential roles in CNS
            development, homeostasis and response to disease. Since microglia
            are difficult to procure from the human brain, several protocols
            have been developed to generate microglia-like cells from human
            induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). However, some concerns
            remain over the purity and quality of in vitro generated
            microglia. Here, we describe a new protocol that does not require
            co-culture with neural cells and yields cultures of 100\% P2Y12+
            95\% TMEM119+ ramified human microglia-like cells (hiPSC-MG). In
            the presence of neural precursor cell-conditioned media, hiPSC-MG
            expressed high levels of human microglia signature genes,
            including SALL1, CSF1R, P2RY12, TMEM119, TREM2, HEXB and
            SIGLEC11, as revealed by whole-transcriptome analysis.
            Stimulation of hiPSC-MG with lipopolysaccharide resulted in
            downregulation of P2Y12 expression, induction of IL1B mRNA
            expression and increase in cell capacitance. HiPSC-MG were
            phagocytically active and maintained their cell identity after
            transplantation into murine brain slices and human brain
            spheroids. Together, our new protocol for the generation of
            microglia-like cells from human iPSCs will facilitate the study
            of human microglial function in health and disease.}
