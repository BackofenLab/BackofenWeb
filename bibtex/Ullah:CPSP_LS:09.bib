abstract = {We propose a two-stage optimization approach for protein
            folding simulation in the FCC lattice, inspired from the phenomenon of
            hydrophobic collapse. Given a protein sequence, the first stage of the
            approach produces compact protein structures with the maximal number
            of contacts among hydrophobic monomers, using the CPSP tools for
            optimal structure prediction in the HP model. The second stage uses
            those compact structures as starting points to further optimize the protein
            structure for the input sequence by employing simulated annealing
            local search and a 20 amino acid pairwise interactions energy function.
            Experimental results with PDB sequences show that compact structures
            produced by the CPSP tools are up to two orders of magnitude better,
            in terms of the pairwise energy function, than randomly generated ones.
            Also, initializing simulated annealing with these compact structures, produces
            better structures in fewer iterations than initializing with random
            structures. Hence, the proposed two-stage optimization outperforms a
            local search procedure based on simulated annealing alone.}
