abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is an important
            problem, since it reveals information about the transcriptional aspects
            of gene regulation. 
            Our objective is to develop highly accurate binding site models for
            given factors in a stochastic manner.
            Most current solutions suffer from weak specificity. We face this by
            determining highly predicative sequence-related TFBS  features of miscellaneous types and 
            by integrating these features in Bayesian networks to consider dependencies among them.
            Results show a better prediction performance compared to PSSM models.}
