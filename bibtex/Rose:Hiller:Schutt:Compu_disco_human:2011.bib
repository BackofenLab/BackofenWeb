abstract = {MOTIVATION: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) resemble 
            protein-coding mRNAs but do not encode proteins. Most 
            lncRNAs are under lower sequence constraints than 
            protein-coding genes and lack conserved secondary 
            structures, making it hard to predict them computationally. 
            RESULTS: We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs 
            in vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and 
            machine learning. It is based on detecting signatures of 
            characteristic splice site evolution in vertebrate whole 
            genome alignments. First, we predict individual splice 
            sites, then assemble compatible sites into exon candidates, 
            and finally predict multi-exon transcripts. Using a novel 
            method to evaluate typical splice site substitution patterns 
            that explicitly takes the species phylogeny into account, we 
            show that individual splice sites can be accurately 
            predicted. Since our approach relies only on predicted 
            splice sites, it can uncover both coding and non-coding 
            exons. We show that our predicted exons and partial 
            transcripts are mostly non-coding and lack conserved 
            secondary structures. These exons are of particular 
            interest, since existing computational approaches cannot 
            detect them. Transcriptome sequencing data indicate 
            tissue-specific expression patterns of predicted exons and 
            there is evidence that increasing sequencing depth and 
            breadth will validate additional predictions. We also found 
            a significant enrichment of predicted exons that form 
            multi-exon transcript parts, and we experimentally validate 
            such a novel multi-exon gene. Overall, we obtain 336 novel 
            multi-exon transcript predictions from human intergenic 
            regions. Our results indicate the existence of novel human 
            transcripts that are conserved in evolution and our approach 
            contributes to the completion of the human transcript 
            catalog. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Predicted human 
            splice sites, exons and gene structures together with a Perl 
            implementation of the tree-based log-odds scoring and a 
            supplementary PDF file containing additional figures and 
            tables are available at:
