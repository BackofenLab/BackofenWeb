abstract = {MOTIVATION: The identification of protein and gene names 
            (PGNs) from the scientific literature requires semantic 
            resources: Terminological and lexical resources deliver the 
            term candidates into PGN tagging solutions and the gold 
            standard corpora (GSC) train them to identify term 
            parameters and contextual features. Ideally all three 
            resources, i.e. corpora, lexica and taggers, cover the same 
            domain knowledge, and thus support identification of the 
            same types of PGNs and cover all of them. Unfortunately, 
            none of the three serves as a predominant standard and for 
            this reason it is worth exploring, how these three resources 
            comply with each other. We systematically compare different 
            PGN taggers against publicly available corpora and analyze 
            the impact of the included lexical resource in their 
            performance. In particular, we determine the performance 
            gains through false positive filtering, which contributes to 
            the disambiguation of identified PGNs. RESULTS: In general, 
            machine learning approaches (ML-Tag) for PGN tagging show 
            higher F1-measure performance against the BioCreative-II and 
            Jnlpba GSCs (exact matching), whereas the lexicon based 
            approaches (LexTag) in combination with disambiguation 
            methods show better results on FsuPrge and PennBio. The 
            ML-Tag solutions balance precision and recall, whereas the 
            LexTag solutions have different precision and recall 
            profiles at the same F1-measure across all corpora. Higher 
            recall is achieved with larger lexical resources, which also 
            introduce more noise (false positive results). The ML-Tag 
            solutions certainly perform best, if the test corpus is from 
            the same GSC as the training corpus. As expected, the false 
            negative errors characterize the test corpora and - on the 
            other hand - the profiles of the false positive mistakes 
            characterize the tagging solutions. Lex-Tag solutions that 
            are based on a large terminological resource in combination 
            with false positive filtering produce better results, which, 
            in addition, provide concept identifiers from a knowledge 
            source in contrast to ML-Tag solutions. CONCLUSION: The 
            standard ML-Tag solutions achieve high performance, but not 
            across all corpora, and thus should be trained using several 
            different corpora to reduce possible biases. The LexTag 
            solutions have different profiles for their precision and 
            recall performance, but with similar F1-measure. This result 
            is surprising and suggests that they cover a portion of the 
            most common naming standards, but cope differently with the 
            term variability across the corpora. The false positive 
            filtering applied to LexTag solutions does improve the 
            results by increasing their precision without compromising 
            significantly their recall. The harmonisation of the 
            annotation schemes in combination with standardized lexical 
            resources in the tagging solutions will enable their 
            comparability and will pave the way for a shared standard.}
