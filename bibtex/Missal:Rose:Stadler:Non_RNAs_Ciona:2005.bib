abstract = {MOTIVATION: The analysis of animal genomes showed that only 
            a minute part of their DNA codes for proteins. Recent 
            experimental results agree, however, that a large fraction 
            of these genomes are transcribed and hence are probably 
            functional at the RNA level. A computational survey of 
            vertebrate genomes has predicted thousands of previously 
            unknown ncRNAs with evolutionarily conserved secondary 
            structures. Extending these comparative studies beyond 
            vertebrates is difficult, however, since most ncRNAs evolve 
            quickly at the sequence level while conserving their 
            characteristic secondarystructures. RESULTS: We report on a 
            computational screen of structured ncRNAs in the urochordate 
            lineage based on a comparison of the genomic data from Ciona 
            intestinalis, Ciona savignyi and Oikopleura dioica. We 
            predict >1000 ncRNAs with an evolutionarily conserved RNA 
            secondary structure. Of these, about a quarter are located 
            in introns of known protein coding sequences. A few RNA 
            motifs can be identified as known RNAs, including 
            approximately 300 tRNAs, some 100 snRNA genes and a few 
            microRNAs and snoRNAs. AVAILABILITY:
