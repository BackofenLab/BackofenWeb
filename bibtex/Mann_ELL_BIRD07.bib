abstract = {The study of energy landscapes of biopolymers and their
            models is an important field in bioinformatics. For
            instance the investigation of kinetics or folding
            simulations are done using methods that are based on
            sampling or exhaustive enumeration. Most of such
            algorithms are independent of the underlying landscape
            model. Therefore frameworks for generic algorithms to
            investigate the landscape properties is needed. Here,
            we present the Energy Landscape Library (ELL) that
            allows such a model-independent formulation of generic
            algorithms dealing with discrete states. The ELL  is a
            completely object-oriented C++ library that is highly
            modular, easy to extend, and freely available
            online. It can be used for a fast and easy
            implementation of new generic algorithms (possibly
            based on the provided basic method pool) or as a
            framework to test their properties for different
            landscape models, which can be formulated
            straightforward.}
