   abstract = {pclife, a dialect of the LIFE language designed by \ait, extends
the original design by some features, the most important of which are
distributed disjunctions.  LIFE integrates the functional and the
logic-oriented programming styles, and feature types supporting
inheritance.  This language is well suited for knowledge
representation, in particular for applications in computational
linguistics.
