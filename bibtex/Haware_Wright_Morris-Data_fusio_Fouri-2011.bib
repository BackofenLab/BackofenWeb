abstract = {Fusing complex data from two disparate sources has been 
            demonstrated to improve the accuracy in quantifying active 
            ingredients in mixtures of pharmaceutical powders. A 
            four-component simplex-centroid design was used to prepare 
            blended powder mixtures of acetaminophen, caffeine, aspirin 
            and ibuprofen. The blends were analyzed by Fourier transform 
            infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction 
            (PXRD). The FTIR and PXRD data were preprocessed and 
            combined using two different data fusion methods: fusion of 
            preprocessed data (FPD) and fusion of principal component 
            scores (FPCS). A partial least square (PLS) model built on 
            the FPD did not improve the root mean square error of 
            prediction. However, a PLS model built on the FPCS yielded 
            better accuracy prediction than PLS models built on 
            individual FTIR and PXRD data sets. The improvement in 
            prediction accuracy of the FPCS may be attributed to the 
            removal of noise and data reduction associated with using 
            PCA as a preprocessing tool. The present approach 
            demonstrates the usefulness of data fusion for the 
            information management of large data sets from disparate 
            sources.}
