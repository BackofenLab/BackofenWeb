abstract = {Genome-wide multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are a 
            necessary prerequisite for an increasingly diverse 
            collection of comparative genomic approaches. Here we 
            present a versatile method that generates high-quality MSAs 
            for non-protein-coding sequences. The NcDNAlign pipeline 
            combines pairwise BLAST alignments to create initial MSAs, 
            which are then locally improved and trimmed. The program is 
            optimized for speed and hence is particulary well-suited to 
            pilot studies. We demonstrate the practical use of NcDNAlign 
            in three case studies: the search for ncRNAs in 
            gammaproteobacteria and the analysis of conserved noncoding 
            DNA in nematodes and teleost fish, in the latter case 
            focusing on the fate of duplicated ultra-conserved regions. 
            Compared to the currently widely used genome-wide alignment 
            program TBA, our program results in a 20- to 30-fold 
            reduction of CPU time necessary to generate 
            gammaproteobacterial alignments. A showcase application of 
            bacterial ncRNA prediction based on alignments of both 
            algorithms results in similar sensitivity, false discovery 
            rates, and up to 100 putatively novel ncRNA structures. 
            Similar findings hold for our application of NcDNAlign to 
            the identification of ultra-conserved regions in nematodes 
            and teleosts. Both approaches yield conserved sequences of 
            unknown function, result in novel evolutionary insights into 
            conservation patterns among these genomes, and manifest the 
            benefits of an efficient and reliable genome-wide alignment 
            package. The software is available under the GNU Public
