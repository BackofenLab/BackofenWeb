abstract = {The prokaryotic immune system CRISPR-Cas (clustered 
            regularly interspaced short palindromic 
            repeats-CRISPR-associated) is a defense system that protects 
            prokaryotes against foreign DNA. The short CRISPR RNAs 
            (crRNAs) are central components of this immune system. In 
            CRISPR-Cas systems type I and III, crRNAs are generated by 
            the endonuclease Cas6. We developed a Cas6b-independent 
            crRNA maturation pathway for the Haloferax type I-B system 
            in vivo that expresses a functional crRNA, which we termed 
            independently generated crRNA (icrRNA). The icrRNA is 
            effective in triggering degradation of an invader plasmid 
            carrying the matching protospacer sequence. The 
            Cas6b-independent maturation of the icrRNA allowed mutation 
            of the repeat sequence without interfering with signals 
            important for Cas6b processing. We generated 23 variants of 
            the icrRNA and analyzed them for activity in the 
            interference reaction. icrRNAs with deletions or mutations 
            of the 3' handle are still active in triggering an 
            interference reaction. The complete 3' handle could be 
            removed without loss of activity. However, manipulations of 
            the 5' handle mostly led to loss of interference activity. 
            Furthermore, we could show that in the presence of an icrRNA 
            a strain without Cas6b (Deltacas6b) is still active in 
            interference.}
