abstract = {Selenocysteine (Sec) is a recently discovered 21st amino acid.
            Selenocysteine is encoded by the nucleotide triplet UGA, which is
            usually interpreted as a STOP signal. The insertion of
            selenocysteine requires an additional signal in form of a
            SECIS-element (\textbf{Se}leno\textbf{c}ysteine \textbf{I}nsertion
            \textbf{S}equence). This is an mRNA-motif, which is defined by both
            sequence-related and structure-related properties.
            
            The bioinformatics problem of interest is to design new selenoproteins
            (i.e., proteins containing  selenocysteine), since seleno variants of
            proteins are very useful in structure analysis. When designing
            new bacterial selenoproteins, one encounters the problem that 
            the SECIS-element itself is translated (and therefore encodes a
            subsequence of the complete protein). Hence, changes on the
            level of mRNA made in order to 
            generate a SECIS-element will also modify the amino acid
            sequence. Thus, one searches for an mRNA that is maximally similar to a
            SECIS-element, and for which the encoded amino acid sequence is
            maximally similar to the original amino acid sequence. In addition, it
            must satisfy the  constraints imposed by the structure. 
            
            Though the problem is NP-complete if arbitrary structural constraints are
            allowed, it can be solved efficiently when we consider the structures
            as used in SECIS-elements. The remaining 
            problem is to generate a description of the
            SECIS-element (and its diversity) based on the 
            available data.}
