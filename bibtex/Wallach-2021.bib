abstract = {Results: We identified a specific pattern of miRNAs released from apoptotic cortical neurons that activate TLR7 and/or TLR8, depending on sequence and species. Exposure of microglia and macrophages to certain miRNA classes released from apoptotic neurons resulted in the sequence-specific production of distinct cytokines/ chemokines and increased phagocytic activity. Out of those miRNAs miR-100-5p and miR-298-5p, which have consistently been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, entered microglia, located to their endosomes, and directly bound to human TLR8. The miRNA-TLR interaction required novel sequence features, but no specific structure formation of mature miRNA. As a consequence of miR-100-5p- and miR-298-5p-induced TLR activation, cortical neurons underwent cell-autonomous apoptosis. Presence of miR-100-5p and miR-298-5p in cerebrospinal fluid led to neurodegeneration and microglial accumulation in the murine cerebral cortex through TLR7 signaling. 
            Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that specific miRNAs are released from apoptotic cortical neurons, serve as endogenous TLR7/8 ligands, and thereby trigger further neuronal apoptosis in the CNS. Our findings underline the recently discovered role of miRNAs as extracellular signaling molecules, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration.
