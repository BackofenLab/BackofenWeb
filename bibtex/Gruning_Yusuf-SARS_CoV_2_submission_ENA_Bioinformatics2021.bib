abstract = {SUMMARY: Many aspects of the global response to the COVID-19
            pandemic are enabled by the fast and open publication of
            SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data. The European Nucleotide Archive
            (ENA) is the European recommended open repository for genetic
            sequences. In this work, we present a tool for submitting raw
            sequencing reads of SARS-CoV-2 to ENA. The tool features a
            single-step submission process, a graphical user interface,
            tabular-formatted metadata and the possibility to remove human
            reads prior to submission. A Galaxy wrap of the tool allows users
            with little or no bioinformatic knowledge to do bulk sequencing
            read submissions. The tool is also packed in a Docker container
            to ease deployment. AVAILABILITY: CLI ENA upload tool is
            available at github.com/usegalaxy-eu/ena-upload-cli (DOI
            10.5281/zenodo.4537621); Galaxy ENA upload tool at
