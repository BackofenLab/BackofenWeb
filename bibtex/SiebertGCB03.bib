abstract = {We describe an algorithmic method for multiple
            alignment of RNAs taking into consideration both the
            primary sequence and the secondary structure. In a
            first step, alignment edges between nucleotides are
            produced by pairwise sequence/structure comparisons
            of RNAs. They are weighted with similarity scores
            transformed from edit distances as proposed by
            Zhang. In a next step, the set of alignment edges
            are given as input to the multiple alignment program
            T-COFFEE. Here, edges that are supported by several
            pairwise alignments are strengthened. An example of
            tRNA sequences from the Rfam database with their
            typical cloverleaf structure is given. In addition,
            we compare this alignment with a traditional
            multiple sequence alignment program: clustalw. The
            MARNA server is available at
