abstract = {Sparsification is a technique to speed up dynamic
            programming algorithms which has been suc- cessfully
            applied to RNA structure prediction,
            RNA-RNA-interaction prediction, simultaneous align-
            ment and folding, and pseudoknot prediction. So far,
            sparsification has been more a collection of loosely
            related examples and no general, well understood
            theory. In this work we propose a general theory to
            describe and implement sparsification in dynamic
            programming algorithms. The approach is formalized
            as an extension of Algebraic Dynamic Programming
            (ADP) which makes it applicable to a variety of
            algorithms and scoring schemes. In particular, this
            is the first approach that shows how to sparsify
            algorithms with scoring schemes that go beyond
            simple minimization or maximiza- tion, like
            enumeration of suboptimal solutions and
            approximation of the partition function. As an
            example, we show how to sparsify different variants
            of RNA structure prediction algorithms.}
