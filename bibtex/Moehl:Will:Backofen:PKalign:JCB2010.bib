abstract = {Prediction and alignment of RNA pseudoknot structures are 
            NP-hard. Nevertheless, several efficient prediction 
            algorithms by dynamic programming have been proposed for 
            restricted classes of pseudoknots. We present a general 
            scheme that yields an efficient alignment algorithm for 
            arbitrary such classes. Moreover, we show that such an 
            alignment algorithm benefits from the class restriction in 
            the same way as the corresponding structure prediction 
            algorithm does. We look at six of these classes in greater 
            detail. The time and space complexity of the alignment 
            algorithm is increased by only a linear factor over the 
            respective prediction algorithm. For five of the classes, no 
            efficient alignment algorithms were known. For the sixth, 
            most general class, we improve the previously best 
            complexity of O(n(5)m(5)) time to O(nm(6)), where n and m 
            denote sequence lengths. Finally, we apply our fastest 
            algorithm with O(nm(4)) time and O(nm(2)) space to 
            comparative de-novo pseudoknot prediction.}
