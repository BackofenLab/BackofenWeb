abstract = {MODERNA is an algorithm for MOtif DEsign of RNA
            (e.g. SECIS-elements) with both structure and sequence constraints 
            within the coding region of an mRNA. Nevertheless, a certain
            similarity to the original protein is kept. It can be used e.g. for recombinant 
            expression of several selenoproteins in E.coli.}
