abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several recent studies indicate that 
            alternative splicing in Arabidopsis and other plants is a 
            common mechanism for post-transcriptional modulation of gene 
            expression. However, few analyses have been done so far to 
            elucidate the functional relevance of alternative splicing 
            in higher plants. Representing a frequent and universal 
            subtle alternative splicing event among eukaryotes, 
            alternative splicing at NAGNAG acceptors contributes to 
            transcriptome diversity and therefore, proteome plasticity. 
            Alternatively spliced NAGNAG acceptors are overrepresented 
            in genes coding for proteins with RNA-recognition motifs 
            (RRMs). As SR proteins, a family of RRM-containing important 
            splicing factors, are known to be extensively alternatively 
            spliced in Arabidopsis, we analyzed alternative splicing at 
            NAGNAG acceptors in SR and SR-related genes. RESULTS: In a 
            comprehensive analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 
            we identified 6,772 introns that exhibit a NAGNAG acceptor 
            motif. Alternative splicing at these acceptors was assessed 
            using available EST data, complemented by a sequence-based 
            prediction method. Of the 36 identified introns within 30 SR 
            and SR-related protein-coding genes that have a NAGNAG 
            acceptor, we selected 15 candidates for an experimental 
            analysis of alternative splicing under several conditions. 
            We provide experimental evidence for 8 of these candidates 
            being alternatively spliced. Quantifying the ratio of 
            NAGNAG-derived splice variants under several conditions, we 
            found organ-specific splicing ratios in adult plants and 
            changes in seedlings of different ages. Splicing ratio 
            changes were observed in response to heat shock and most 
            strikingly, cold shock. Interestingly, the patterns of 
            differential splicing ratios are similar for all analyzed 
            genes. CONCLUSION: NAGNAG acceptors frequently occur in the 
            Arabidopsis genome and are particularly prevalent in SR and 
            SR-related protein-coding genes. A lack of extensive EST 
            coverage can be compensated by using the proposed 
            sequence-based method to predict alternative splicing at 
            these acceptors. Our findings indicate that the differential 
            effects on NAGNAG alternative splicing in SR and SR-related 
            genes are organ- and condition-specific rather than 
            gene-specific.}
