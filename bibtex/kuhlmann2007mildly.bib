            Dependency-based  representations  of  natural  language  syntax  require  a  fine  balance  between  structural  flexibility  and  computational  complexity.  In  previous  work,  several  constraints  have  been  proposed  to  identify  classes  of  dependency  structures  that  are  well-balanced  in  this  sense;  the  best-known  but  also  most  restrictive  of  these  is  projectivity.  Most  constraints  are  formulated  on  fully  specified  structures,  which  makes  them  hard  to  integrate  into  models  where  structures  are  composed  from  lexical  information.  In  this  paper,  we  show  how  two  empirically  relevant  relaxations  of  projectivity  can  be  lexicalized,  and  how  combining  the  resulting  lexicons  with  a  regular  means  of  syntactic  composition  gives  rise  to  a  hierarchy  of  mildly  context-sensitive  dependency  languages.  Our  results  provide  fundamental  insights  into  the  relation  between  structural  properties  of  dependency  representations  and  notions  of  formal  power.}
