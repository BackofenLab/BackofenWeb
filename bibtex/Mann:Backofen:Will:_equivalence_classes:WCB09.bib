abstract = {Lattice protein models, as the Hydrophobic-Polar
            (HP) model, are a common abstraction to enable
            exhaustive studies on structure, function, or
            evolution of proteins. A main issue is the high
            number of optimal structures, resulting from the
            hydrophobicity-based energy function applied. We
            introduce an equivalence relation on protein
            structures that correlates to the energy
            function. We discuss the efficient enumeration of
            optimal representatives of the corresponding
            equivalence classes and the application of the
            results.}
