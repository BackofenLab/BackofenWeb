abstract = {The prediction of matches to probabilistic 
            sequences motifs within biological sequence is a key task of computational biology. 
            Since single hits of these short  motifs tend to be 
            false positives, 
            recent research is concentrating on additional biological knowledge for
            separating real matches from background. Especially 
            the preference of various motifs to occur in combination with  
            other motifs (clusters) seems to have exquisite filtering properties. 
            Often, there are constraints about order, distance and orientation
            among the members of such clusters. Examples are functionally related transcription
            factor binding sites and alternative splice enhancers.
            We present a strategy for modelling the sequence properties of single
            motifs and the motif match arrangements of related motifs}
