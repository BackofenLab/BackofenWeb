abstract = {  Chemical reactions are rearrangements of chemical bonds.  Each atom in an
            educt molecule thus appears again in a specific position of one of the
            reaction products. This bijection between educt and product atoms is not
            reported by chemical reaction databases, however, so that the 'Atom
            Mapping Problem' of finding this bijection is left as an important
            computational task for many practical applications in computational
            chemistry and systems biology. Elementary chemical reactions feature a
            cyclic imaginary transition state (ITS) that imposes additional
            restrictions on the bijection between educt and product atoms that are
            not taken into account by previous approaches. We demonstrate that
            Constraint Programming is well-suited to solving the Atom Mapping Problem
            in this setting.  The performance of our approach is evaluated for a manually
            curated subset of chemical reactions from the KEGG database featuring various ITS
            cycle layouts and reaction mechanisms.}
