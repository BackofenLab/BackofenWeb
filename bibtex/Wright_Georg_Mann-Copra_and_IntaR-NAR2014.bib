abstract = {CopraRNA (Comparative prediction algorithm for small RNA 
            targets) is the most recent asset to the Freiburg RNA Tools 
            webserver. It incorporates and extends the functionality of 
            the existing tool IntaRNA (Interacting RNAs) in order to 
            predict targets, interaction domains and consequently the 
            regulatory networks of bacterial small RNA molecules. The 
            CopraRNA prediction results are accompanied by extensive 
            postprocessing methods such as functional enrichment 
            analysis and visualization of interacting regions. Here, we 
            introduce the functionality of the CopraRNA and IntaRNA 
            webservers and give detailed explanations on their 
            postprocessing functionalities. Both tools are freely 
            accessible at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de.}
