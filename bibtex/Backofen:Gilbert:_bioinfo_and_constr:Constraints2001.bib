abstract = {This article introduces the topic of bioinformatics to an
            audience of computer scientists. We discuss the definition of
            bioinformatics, give a classification of the problem areas which
            bioinformatics addresses, and illustrate these in detail with
            examples. We highlight those areas which we believe to be suitable
            for the application of constraint solving techniques, or where
            similar techniques are already used. Finally, we give some advice for
            computer scientists who are considering getting involved in
            bioinformatics, and provide a resource list and a reading list.
