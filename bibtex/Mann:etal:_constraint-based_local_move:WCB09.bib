abstract = {The simulation of a protein's folding process is
            often done via stochastic local search, which
            requires a procedure to apply structural changes
            onto a given conformation. Here, we introduce a
            constraint-based approach to enumerate lattice
            protein structures according to k-local moves in
            arbitrary lattices. Our declarative description is
            much more flexible for extensions than standard
            operational formulations. It enables a generic
            calculation of k-local neighbors in backbone-only
            and side chain models. We exemplify the procedure
            using a simple hierarchical folding scheme.}
