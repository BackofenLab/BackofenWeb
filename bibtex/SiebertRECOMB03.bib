abstract = {We present a new method that finds and aligns local
            sequence structure segments in a set of unaligned
            RNA sequences of unknown structures. Secondary
            structural features of RNA sequences are detected
            given a structural hint, e.g. a stem loop. They form
            the basis of assigning RNA sequences to their final
            local sequence structure segments. These segments
            are characterized by highly probable occurrences
            combined with high sequence structure similarities
            among them. Multiple alignment of these regions is
            done by the program T-Coffee. There are a lot of
            multiple sequence alignment programs which consider
            and handle primary sequences quite well. But they
            lack of finding and aligning structural features of
            RNA sequences. RNA sequences are often more
            conserved in their secondary structure than in their
            primary sequence. Sankoff was one of the first who
            proposed a dynamic programming algorithm that aligns
            a set of RNA sequences while predicting their common
            structures. The most promising approach is the use
            of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFG), which
            perform global alignments and find a covariance
            model. Covariance models work well in finding common
            structural constraints of whole RNA sequences but
            are not intended to find common local structure
            properties. FOLDALIGN from G.D. Stormo is a program
            which considers sequence and structure motifs using
            nucleotide similarities and basepair maximization.}
