abstract = {We report on the characterization and target analysis of 
            the small (s)RNA(162) in the methanoarchaeon Methanosarcina 
            mazei. Using a combination of genetic approaches, 
            transcriptome analysis and computational predictions, the 
            bicistronic MM2441-MM2440 mRNA encoding the transcription 
            factor MM2441 and a protein of unknown function was 
            identified as a potential target of this sRNA, which due to 
            processing accumulates as three stabile 5' fragments in late 
            exponential growth. Mobility shift assays using various 
            mutants verified that the non-structured single-stranded 
            linker region of sRNA(162) (SLR) base-pairs with the 
            MM2440-MM2441 mRNA internally, thereby masking the predicted 
            ribosome binding site of MM2441. This most likely leads to 
            translational repression of the second cistron resulting in 
            dis-coordinated operon expression. Analysis of mutant RNAs 
            in vivo confirmed that the SLR of sRNA(162) is crucial for 
            target interactions. Furthermore, our results indicate that 
            sRNA(162)-controlled MM2441 is involved in regulating the 
            metabolic switch between the carbon sources methanol and 
            methylamine. Moreover, biochemical studies demonstrated that 
            the 5' end of sRNA(162) targets the 5'-untranslated region 
            of the cis-encoded MM2442 mRNA. Overall, this first study of 
            archaeal sRNA/mRNA-target interactions unraveled that 
            sRNA(162) acts as an antisense (as)RNA on cis- and 
            trans-encoded mRNAs via two distinct domains, indicating 
            that cis-encoded asRNAs can have larger target regulons than 
            previously anticipated.}
