abstract = {There are thousands of well-maintained high-quality 
            open-source software utilities for all aspects of scientific 
            data analysis. For more than a decade, the Galaxy Project 
            has been providing computational infrastructure and a 
            unified user interface for these tools to make them 
            accessible to a wide range of researchers. To streamline the 
            process of integrating tools and constructing workflows as 
            much as possible, we have developed Planemo, a software 
            development kit for tool and workflow developers and Galaxy 
            power users. Here we outline Planemo's implementation and 
            describe its broad range of functionality for designing, 
            testing, and executing Galaxy tools, workflows, and training 
            material. In addition, we discuss the philosophy underlying 
            Galaxy tool and workflow development, and how Planemo 
            encourages the use of development best practices, such as 
            test-driven development, by its users, including those who 
            are not professional software developers.}
