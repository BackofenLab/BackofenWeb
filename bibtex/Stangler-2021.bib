abstract = {{Research Highlights: Our results provide novel perspectives on the effectiveness and collapse 
            of compensatory mechanisms of tracheid development of Norway spruce during intra-seasonal 
            drought and the environmental control of intra-annual density fluctuations. Background and 
            Objectives: This study aimed to compare and integrate complementary methods of investigating 
            intra-annual wood formation dynamics to gain a better understanding of the endogenous and 
            environmental control of tree-ring development and the impact of anticipated climatic changes on forest 
            growth and productivity. Materials and Methods: We performed an integrated analysis of xylogenesis 
            observations, quantitative wood anatomy and point-dendrometer measurements of Norway spruce 
            (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees growing along an elevational gradient in south-western Germany during 
            a growing season with an anomalous dry June followed by an extraordinary humid July. Results: 
            Strong endogenous control of tree-ring formation was suggested at the highest elevation where the 
            decreasing rates of tracheid enlargement and wall thickening during drought were effectively compensated 
            by increased cell differentiation duration. A shift to environmental control of tree-ring 
            formation during drought was indicated at the lowest elevation, where we detected absence of compensatory 
            mechanisms, eventually stimulating the formation of an intra-annual density fluctuation. Transient 
            drought stress in June also led to bimodal patterns and decreasing daily rates of stem 
            radial displacement, radial xylem growth and woody biomass production. Comparing xylogenesis 
            data with dendrometer measurements showed ambivalent results and it appears that with decreasing 
            daily rates of radial xylem growth, the signal-to-noise ratio in dendrometer time series between 
            growth and fluctuations of tree water status becomes increasingly detrimental. Conclusions: Our 
            study provides new perspectives into the complex interplay between rates and durations of tracheid 
            development during dry-wet cycles, and thereby contributes to an improved and mechanistic understanding 
            of the environmental control of wood formation processes leading to the formation of 
            intra-annual density fluctuations in tree-rings of Norway spruce.}}
