abstract = {
            There  are  two  major  approaches  to  formal  accounts  of  the  syntax  of  natural  language,  the  proof-theoretic  and  the  model-theoretic  approach.  Both  aim  at  providing  frameworks  for  answering  the  question  whether  a  given  natural  language  expression  is  grammatical.  Their  methodology,  however,  is  rather  different:  In  a  proof-theoretic  framework,  one  tries  to  set  up  a  system  of  derivation  rules  (such  as  the  rules  in  a  context-free  grammar)  so  that  each  well-formed  natural  language  expression  stands  in  correspondence  with  a  derivation  in  that  system.  In  contrast,  in  a  model-theoretic  framework,  one  attempts  to  specify  a  class  of  models  for  natural  language  expressions  and  a  set  of  constraints  on  these  models  such  that  an  expression  is  well-formed  iff  it  has  a  model  satisfying  all  the  constraints.  The  main  contribution  of  this  paper  is  the  characterisation  of  a  class  of  structures  that  provides  a  new  model-based  perspective  on  Tree  Adjoining  Grammar  (Joshi  and  Schabes  (1997)),  a  well-known  proof-theoretic  syntactic  framework.}
