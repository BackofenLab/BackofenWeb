abstract = {Determining the structural properties of mRNA is key to 
            understanding vital post-transcriptional processes. As 
            experimental data on mRNA structure are scarce, accurate 
            structure prediction is required to characterize RNA 
            regulatory mechanisms. Although various structure prediction 
            approaches are available, it is often unclear which to 
            choose and how to set their parameters. Furthermore, no 
            standard measure to compare predictions of local structure 
            exists. We assessed the performance of different methods 
            using two types of data: transcriptome-wide enzymatic 
            probing information and a large, curated set of 
            cis-regulatory elements. To compare the approaches, we 
            introduced structure accuracy, a measure that is applicable 
            to both global and local methods. Our results showed that 
            local folding was more accurate than the classic global 
            approach. We investigated how the locality parameters, 
            maximum base pair span and window size, influenced the 
            prediction performance. A span of 150 provided a reasonable 
            balance between maximizing the number of accurately 
            predicted base pairs, while minimizing effects of incorrect 
            long-range predictions. We characterized the error at 
            artificial sequence ends, which we reduced by setting the 
            window size sufficiently greater than the maximum span. Our 
            method, LocalFold, diminished all border effects and 
            produced the most robust performance.}
