abstract = {MOTIVATION: State-of-the-art experimental data for 
            determining binding specificities of peptide recognition 
            modules (PRMs) is obtained by high-throughput approaches 
            like peptide arrays. Most prediction tools applicable to 
            this kind of data are based on an initial multiple alignment 
            of the peptide ligands. Building an initial alignment can be 
            error-prone, especially in the case of the proline-rich 
            peptides bound by the SH3 domains. RESULTS: Here, we present 
            a machine-learning approach based on an efficient 
            graph-kernel technique to predict the specificity of a large 
            set of 70 human SH3 domains, which are an important class of 
            PRMs. The graph-kernel strategy allows us to (i) integrate 
            several types of physico-chemical information for each amino 
            acid, (ii) consider high-order correlations between these 
            features and (iii) eliminate the need for an initial peptide 
            alignment. We build specialized models for each human SH3 
            domain and achieve competitive predictive performance of 
            0.73 area under precision-recall curve, compared with 0.27 
            area under precision-recall curve for state-of-the-art 
            methods based on position weight matrices. We show that 
            better models can be obtained when we use information on the 
            noninteracting peptides (negative examples), which is 
            currently not used by the state-of-the art approaches based 
            on position weight matrices. To this end, we analyze two 
            strategies to identify subsets of high confidence negative 
            data. The techniques introduced here are more general and 
            hence can also be used for any other protein domains, which 
            interact with short peptides (i.e. other PRMs). 
            AVAILABILITY: The program with the predictive models can be

            We also provide a genome-wide prediction for all 70 human 
            SH3 domains, which can be found under
