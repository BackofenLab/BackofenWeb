abstract = {Molecular classification of cancers into subtypes has 
            resulted in an advance in our understanding of tumour 
            biology and treatment response across multiple tumour types. 
            However, to date, cancer profiling has largely focused on 
            protein-coding genes, which comprise <1% of the genome. Here 
            we leverage a compendium of 58,648 long noncoding RNAs 
            (lncRNAs) to subtype 947 breast cancer samples. We show that 
            lncRNA-based profiling categorizes breast tumours by their 
            known molecular subtypes in breast cancer. We identify a 
            cohort of breast cancer-associated and oestrogen-regulated 
            lncRNAs, and investigate the role of the top prioritized 
            oestrogen receptor (ER)-regulated lncRNA, DSCAM-AS1. We 
            demonstrate that DSCAM-AS1 mediates tumour progression and 
            tamoxifen resistance and identify hnRNPL as an interacting 
            protein involved in the mechanism of DSCAM-AS1 action. By 
            highlighting the role of DSCAM-AS1 in breast cancer biology 
            and treatment resistance, this study provides insight into 
            the potential clinical implications of lncRNAs in breast 
            cancer.}
