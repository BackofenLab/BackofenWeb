abstract = {Alternative splicing can yield manifold different
            mature mRNAs from one precursor. New findings
            indicate that alternative splicing occurs much more
            often than previously assumed. A major goal of
            functional genomics lies in elucidating and
            characterizing the entire spectrum of alternative
            splice forms. Existing approaches such as
            EST-alignments focus only on the mRNA sequence to
            detect alternative splice forms. They do not
            consider function and characteristics of the
            resulting proteins. One important example of such
            functional characterization is homology to a known
            protein domain family. A powerful description of
            protein domains are profile Hidden Markov models
            (HMM) as stored in the Pfam database. In this paper
            we address the problem of identifying the splice
            form with the highest similarity to a protein domain
            family. Therefore, we take into consideration all
            possible splice forms. As demonstrated here for a
            number of genes, this homology based approach can be
            used successfully for predicting partial gene
            structures. Furthermore, we present some novel
            splice form predictions with high-scoring protein
            domain homology and point out that the detection of
            splice form specific protein domains helps to answer
            questions concerning hereditary diseases. Simple
            approaches based on a BLASTP search cannot be
            applied here, since the number of possible splice
            forms increases exponentially with the number of
            exons. To this end, we have developed an efficient
            polynomial-time algorithm, called ASFPred
            (Alternative Splice Form Prediction). This algorithm
            needs only a set of exons as input.}
