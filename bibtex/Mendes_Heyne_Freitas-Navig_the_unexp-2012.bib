abstract = {MOTIVATION: The computational search for novel microRNA 
            (miRNA) precursors often involves some sort of structural 
            analysis with the aim of identifying which type of 
            structures are prone to being recognized and processed by 
            the cellular miRNA-maturation machinery. A natural way to 
            tackle this problem is to perform clustering over the 
            candidate structures along with known miRNA precursor 
            structures. Mixed clusters allow then the identification of 
            candidates that are similar to known precursors. Given the 
            large number of pre-miRNA candidates that can be identified 
            in single-genome approaches, even after applying several 
            filters for precursor robustness and stability, a 
            conventional structural clustering approach is unfeasible. 
            RESULTS: We propose a method to represent candidate 
            structures in a feature space, which summarizes key 
            sequence/structure characteristics of each candidate. We 
            demonstrate that proximity in this feature space is related 
            to sequence/structure similarity, and we select candidates 
            that have a high similarity to known precursors. Additional 
            filtering steps are then applied to further reduce the 
            number of candidates to those with greater transcriptional 
            potential. Our method is compared with another single-genome 
            method (TripletSVM) in two datasets, showing better 
            performance in one and comparable performance in the other, 
            for larger training sets. Additionally, we show that our 
            approach allows for a better interpretation of the results. 
            AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The MinDist method is 
            implemented using Perl scripts and is freely available at
