abstract = {The RNA-binding protein RC3H1 (also known as ROQUIN) 
            promotes TNFalpha mRNA decay via a 3'UTR constitutive decay 
            element (CDE). Here we applied PAR-CLIP to human RC3H1 to 
            identify approximately 3,800 mRNA targets with >16,000 
            binding sites. A large number of sites are distinct from the 
            consensus CDE and revealed a structure-sequence motif with 
            U-rich sequences embedded in hairpins. RC3H1 binds 
            preferentially short-lived and DNA damage-induced mRNAs, 
            indicating a role of this RNA-binding protein in the 
            post-transcriptional regulation of the DNA damage response. 
            Intriguingly, RC3H1 affects expression of the NF-kappaB 
            pathway regulators such as IkappaBalpha and A20. RC3H1 uses 
            ROQ and Zn-finger domains to contact a binding site in the 
            A20 3'UTR, demonstrating a not yet recognized mode of RC3H1 
            binding. Knockdown of RC3H1 resulted in increased A20 
            protein expression, thereby interfering with IkappaB kinase 
            and NF-kappaB activities, demonstrating that RC3H1 can 
            modulate the activity of the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway.}
