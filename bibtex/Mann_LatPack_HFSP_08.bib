abstract = {Knowledge of a protein's 3-dimensional native
            structure is vital in determining its chemical properties
            and functionality. However, experimental
            methods to determine structure are very costly and
            time-consuming. Computational approaches, such
            as folding simulations and structure prediction algorithms,
            are quicker and cheaper but lack consistent
            accuracy. This currently restricts extensive computational
            studies to abstract protein models. It
            is thus essential that simplifications induced by the
            models do not negate scientific value. Key to this is
            the use of thoroughly defined protein-like sequences.
            In such cases abstract models can allow for the investigation
            of important biological questions.
            Here we present a procedure to generate and classify
            protein-like sequence data sets. Our LatPack
            tools, and the approach in general, are applicable
            to arbitrary lattice protein models. Identification
            is based on thermodynamic and kinetic features.
            Further LatPack can incorporate the sequential
            assembly of proteins by addressing co-translational
            folding.
            We demonstrate the approach in the widely used,
            unrestricted 3D-cubic HP-model. The resulting sequence
            set is the first large data set for this model
            exhibiting the protein-like properties required. Our
            data and tools are freely available and can be used
            to investigate protein-related problems. Furthermore
            our data sets can serve as the first benchmark
            sequence sets for folding algorithms that have traditionally
            only been tested on random sequences.}
