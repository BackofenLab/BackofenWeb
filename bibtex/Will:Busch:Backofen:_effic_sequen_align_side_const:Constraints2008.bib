abstract = {Aligning DNA and protein sequences is a core technique in
            molecular biology. Often, it is desirable to include partial
            prior knowledge and conditions in an alignment. Going beyond
            prior work, we aim at the integration of such side
            constraints in free combination into alignment
            algorithms. The most common and successful technique for
            efficient alignment algorithms is dynamic programming
            (DP). However, a weakness of DP is that one cannot include
            additional constraints without specifically tailoring a new
            DP algorithm. Here, we discuss a declarative approach that
            is based on constraint techniques and show how it can be
            extended by formulating additional knowledge as
            constraints. We take special care to obtain the efficiency
            of DP for sequence alignment. This is achieved by careful
            modeling and applying proper solving strategies. Finally, we
            apply our method to the scanning for RNA motifs in large
            sequences. This case study demonstrates how the new approach
            can be used in real biological problems. A prototypic
            implementation of the method is available at
            http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/CTE-Alignment.}
