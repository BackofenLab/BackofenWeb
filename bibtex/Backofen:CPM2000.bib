abstract = {Lattice protein models are a major tool for
            investigating principles of protein folding. For
            this purpose, one needs an algorithm that is
            guaranteed to find the minimal energy conformation
            in some lattice model (at least for some
            sequences). So far, there are only algorithm that
            can find optimal conformations in the cubic
            lattice. In the more interesting case of the
            face-centered-cubic lattice (FCC), which is more
            protein-like, there are no results. One of the
            reasons is that for finding optimal conformations,
            one usually applies a branch-and-bound technique,
            and there are no reasonable bounds known for the
            FCC. We will give such a bound for Dill's HP-model
            on the FCC.}
