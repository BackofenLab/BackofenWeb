abstract = {Long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA) regulates gene expression 
            through transcriptional and epigenetic regulation as well as 
            alternative splicing in the nucleus. In addition, regulation 
            is achieved at the levels of mRNA translation, storage and 
            degradation in the cytoplasm. During recent years, several 
            studies have described the interaction of lncRNAs with 
            enzymes that confer so-called epigenetic modifications, such 
            as DNA methylation, histone modifications and chromatin 
            structure or remodelling. LncRNA interaction with 
            chromatin-modifying enzymes (CME) is an emerging field that 
            confers another layer of complexity in transcriptional 
            regulation. Given that CME-lncRNA interactions have been 
            identified in many biological processes, ranging from 
            development to disease, comprehensive understanding of 
            underlying mechanisms is important to inspire basic and 
            translational research in the future. In this review, we 
            highlight recent findings to extend our understanding about 
            the functional interdependencies between lncRNAs and CMEs 
            that activate or repress gene expression. We focus on recent 
            highlights of molecular and functional roles for CME-lncRNAs 
            and provide an interdisciplinary overview of recent 
            technical and methodological developments that have improved 
            biological and bioinformatical approaches for detection and 
            functional studies of CME-lncRNA interaction.}
