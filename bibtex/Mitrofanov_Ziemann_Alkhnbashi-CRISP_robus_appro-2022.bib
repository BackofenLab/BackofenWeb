abstract = {MOTIVATION: The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a Type II CRISPR 
            system that has rapidly become the most versatile and 
            widespread tool for genome engineering. It consists of two 
            components, the Cas9 effector protein, and a single guide 
            RNA that combines the spacer (for identifying the target) 
            with the tracrRNA, a trans-activating small RNA required for 
            both crRNA maturation and interference. While there are 
            well-established methods for screening Cas effector proteins 
            and CRISPR arrays, the detection of tracrRNA remains the 
            bottleneck in detecting Class 2 CRISPR systems. RESULTS: We 
            introduce a new pipeline CRISPRtracrRNA for screening and 
            evaluation of tracrRNA candidates in genomes. This pipeline 
            combines evidence from different components of the 
            Cas9-sgRNA complex. The core is a newly developed structural 
            model via covariance models from a sequence-structure 
            alignment of experimentally validated tracrRNAs. As 
            additional evidence, we determine the terminator signal 
            (required for the tracrRNA transcription) and the RNA-RNA 
            interaction between the CRISPR array repeat and the 5'-part 
            of the tracrRNA. Repeats are detected via an ML-based 
            approach (CRISPRidenify). Providing further evidence, we 
            detect the cassette containing the Cas9 (Type II CRISPR 
            systems) and Cas12 (Type V CRISPR systems) effector protein. 
            Our tool is the first for detecting tracrRNA for Type V 
            systems. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation 
            of the CRISPRtracrRNA is available on GitHub upon requesting
