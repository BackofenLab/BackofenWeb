abstract = {The protein cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is an 
            essential negative regulator of immune responses, and its 
            loss causes fatal autoimmunity in mice. We studied a large 
            family in which five individuals presented with a complex, 
            autosomal dominant immune dysregulation syndrome 
            characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent infections 
            and multiple autoimmune clinical features. We identified a 
            heterozygous nonsense mutation in exon 1 of CTLA4. Screening 
            of 71 unrelated patients with comparable clinical phenotypes 
            identified five additional families (nine individuals) with 
            previously undescribed splice site and missense mutations in 
            CTLA4. Clinical penetrance was incomplete (eight adults of a 
            total of 19 genetically proven CTLA4 mutation carriers were 
            considered unaffected). However, CTLA-4 protein expression 
            was decreased in regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in both 
            patients and carriers with CTLA4 mutations. Whereas Treg 
            cells were generally present at elevated numbers in these 
            individuals, their suppressive function, CTLA-4 ligand 
            binding and transendocytosis of CD80 were impaired. 
            Mutations in CTLA4 were also associated with decreased 
            circulating B cell numbers. Taken together, mutations in 
            CTLA4 resulting in CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency or impaired 
            ligand binding result in disrupted T and B cell homeostasis 
            and a complex immune dysregulation syndrome.}
