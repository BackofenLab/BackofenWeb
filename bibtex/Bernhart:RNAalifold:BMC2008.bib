abstract = {Background: The prediction of a consensus structure
            for a set of related RNAs is an important first step
            for subsequent analyses. RNAalifold, which computes
            the minimum energy structure that is simultaneously
            formed by a set of aligned sequences, is one of the
            oldest and most widely used tools for this task. In
            recent years, several alternative approaches have
            been advocated, pointing to several shortcomings of
            the original RNAalifold approach.  Results: We show
            that the accuracy of RNAalifold predictions can be
            improved substantially by introducing a different,
            more rational handling of alignment gaps, and by
            replacing the rather simplistic model of covariance
            scoring with more sophisticated RIBOSUM-like scoring
            matrices. These improvements are achieved without
            compromising the computational efficiency of the
            algorithm. We show here that the new version of
            RNAalifold not only outperforms the old one, but
            also several other tools recently developed, on
            different datasets.  Conclusions: The new version of
            RNAalifold not only can replace the old one for
            almost any application but it is also competitive
            with other approaches including those based on
            SCFGs, maximum expected accuracy, or hierarchical
            nearest neighbor classifiers.}
