abstract = {Subtle alternative splice events at tandem splice sites are 
            frequent in eukaryotes and substantially increase the 
            complexity of transcriptomes and proteomes. We have 
            developed a relational database, TassDB (TAndem Splice Site 
            DataBase), which stores extensive data about alternative 
            splice events at GYNGYN donors and NAGNAG acceptors. These 
            splice events are of subtle nature since they mostly result 
            in the insertion/deletion of a single amino acid or the 
            substitution of one amino acid by two others. Currently, 
            TassDB contains 114 554 tandem splice sites of eight 
            species, 5209 of which have EST/mRNA evidence for 
            alternative splicing. In addition, human SNPs that affect 
            NAGNAG acceptors are annotated. The database provides a 
            user-friendly interface to search for specific genes or for 
            genes containing tandem splice sites with specific features 
            as well as the possibility to download large datasets. This 
            database should facilitate further experimental studies and 
            large-scale bioinformatics analyses of tandem splice sites. 
            The database is available at 
            http://helios.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/TassDB/.}
