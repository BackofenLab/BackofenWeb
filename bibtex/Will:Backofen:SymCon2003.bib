abstract = {Symmetry breaking by adding symmetric constraints
            during search usually assumes that symmetric
            constraints are simple. We identify symmetries with
            complex symmetric constraints, where the symmetries
            nevertheless can be handled by a similar method. For
            this aim, we introduce partial symmetries. We
            identify those symmetries in two problems. The photo
            problem is a well known example problem, while the
            alignment problem is a real world problem from
            bioinformatics.}
