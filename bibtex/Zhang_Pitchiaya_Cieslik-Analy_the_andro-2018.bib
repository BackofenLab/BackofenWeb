abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in the 
            development of the normal prostate as well as prostate 
            cancer. Using an integrative transcriptomic analysis of 
            prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, we identified ARLNC1 
            (AR-regulated long noncoding RNA 1) as an important long 
            noncoding RNA that is strongly associated with AR signaling 
            in prostate cancer progression. Not only was ARLNC1 induced 
            by the AR protein, but ARLNC1 stabilized the AR transcript 
            via RNA-RNA interaction. ARLNC1 knockdown suppressed AR 
            expression, global AR signaling and prostate cancer growth 
            in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data support a 
            role for ARLNC1 in maintaining a positive feedback loop that 
            potentiates AR signaling during prostate cancer progression 
            and identify ARLNC1 as a novel therapeutic target.}
