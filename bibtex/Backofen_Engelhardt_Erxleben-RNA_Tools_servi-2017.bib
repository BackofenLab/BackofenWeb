abstract = {The importance of RNA-based regulation is becoming more and 
            more evident. Genome-wide sequencing efforts have shown that 
            the majority of the DNA in eukaryotic genomes is 
            transcribed. Advanced high-throughput techniques like CLIP 
            for the genome-wide detection of RNA-protein interactions 
            have shown that post-transcriptional regulation by 
            RNA-binding proteins matches the complexity of 
            transcriptional regulation. The need for a specialized and 
            integrated analysis of RNA-based data has led to the 
            foundation of the RNA Bioinformatics Center (RBC) within the 
            German Network of Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI). 
            This paper describes the tools, services and databases 
            provided by the RBC, and shows example applications. 
            Furthermore, we have setup an RNA workbench within the 
            Galaxy framework. For an easy dissemination, we offer a 
            virtualized version of Galaxy (via Galaxy Docker) enabling 
            other groups to use our RNA workbench in a very simple way.}
