abstract = {The prokaryotic immune system CRISPR-Cas1 is a defence 
            system that protects prokaryotes against foreign DNA. The 
            short CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) are central components of this 
            immune system. In CRISPR-Cas systems type I and III crRNAs 
            are generated by the endonuclease Cas6. We developed a 
            Cas6b2-independent crRNA maturation pathway for the 
            Haloferax type I-B system in vivo, that expresses a 
            functional crRNA that we termed independently generated 
            crRNA (icrRNA). The icrRNA is effective in triggering 
            degradation of an invader plasmid carrying the matching 
            protospacer sequence. The Cas6b-independent maturation of 
            the icrRNA allowed mutation of the repeat sequence without 
            interfering with signals important for Cas6b processing. We 
            generated 23 variants of the icrRNA and analysed them for 
            activity in the interference reaction. icrRNAs with 
            deletions or mutations of the 3' handle are still active in 
            triggering a interference reaction. The complete 3' handle 
            could be removed without loss of activity. However 
            manipulations of the 5' handle mostly led to loss of 
            interference activity. Furthermore we could show that in the 
            presence of an icrRNA a strain without Cas6b (cas6b) is 
            still active in interference.}
