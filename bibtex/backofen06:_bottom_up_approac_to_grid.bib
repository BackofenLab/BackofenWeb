abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the need for
            highperformance computing. These demands come from
            disciplines such as particle physics traditionally
            relying on High Performance Computing (HPC) but lately
            also from the various branches of life science that
            have matured into quantitative disciplines. The
            classical infrastructure of university computer
            centres results to be unsuited to cope with the new
            requirements for a multitude of reasons. Here we
            discuss the causes of this failure and present a
            solution developed at the University of Freiburg in a
            collaborative effort of several faculties. We
            demonstrate that using state of the art grid computing
            technology the problem can now be addressed in a
            bottom-up approach. The organizational, technical, and
            financial components of our framework, the Black
            Forest Grid Initiative (BFG) are described and results
            of its implementation are presented. In the process, a
            number of new questions have emerged which the next
            phase of our project needs to address}
