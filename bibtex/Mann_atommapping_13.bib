abstract = {Chemical reactions consist of a rearrangement of bonds so that each atom
            in an educt molecule appears again in a specific position of a reaction
            product. In general this bijection between educt and product atoms is not
            reported by chemical reaction databases, leaving the Atom Mapping Problem
            as an important computational task for many practical applications in
            computational chemistry and systems biology. Elementary chemical
            reactions feature a cyclic imaginary transition state (ITS) that imposes
            additional restrictions on the bijection between educt and product atoms
            that are not taken into account by previous approaches. We demonstrate
            that Constraint Programming is well-suited to solving the Atom Mapping
            Problem in this setting.  The performance of our approach is evaluated
            for a subset of chemical reactions from the KEGG database featuring various
            ITS cycle layouts and reaction mechanisms.}
