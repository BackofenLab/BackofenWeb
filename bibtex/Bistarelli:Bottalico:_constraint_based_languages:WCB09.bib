  abstract =	 {In this paper, we study the modelization of
                  biochemical reaction by using concurrent constraint
                  programming idioms. In particular we will consider
                  the stochastic concurrent constraint programming
                  (sCCP), the Hybrid concurrent constraint programming
                  languages (Hcc) and the Biochemical Abstract
                  Machines (BIOCHAM).  <p> Keywords: Biochemical
                  Reactions, (Stochastic - Hybrid) Concurrent
                  Constraint Programming, Biocham.}
