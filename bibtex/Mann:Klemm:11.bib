abstract = {Many physical and chemical processes, such as folding of biopolymers, are best
            described as dynamics on large combinatorial energy landscapes. A concise
            approximate description of the dynamics is obtained by partitioning the
            micro-states of the landscape into macro-states. Since most landscapes of
            interest are not tractable analytically, the probabilities of transitions
            between macro-states need to be extracted numerically from the microscopic ones,
            typically by full enumeration of the state space or approximations using the
            Arrhenius law. Here we propose to approximate transition probabilities by a
            Markov chain Monte-Carlo method. For landscapes of the number partitioning
            problem and an RNA switch molecule we show that the method allows for accurate
            probability estimates with significantly reduced computational cost.}
