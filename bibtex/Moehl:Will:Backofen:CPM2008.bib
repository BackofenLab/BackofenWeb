abstract = {We present an algorithm that computes the edit
            distance of two RNA structures with arbitrary kinds
            of pseudoknots. A main benefit of the algorithm is
            that, despite the problem is NP-hard, the
            algorithmic complexity adapts to the complexity of
            the RNA structures. Due to fixed parameter
            tractability, we can guarantee polynomial run-time
            for a parameter which is small in practice. Our
            algorithm can be considered as a generalization of
            the algorithm of Jiang et al.~(Jiang, 2002) to
            arbitrary pseudoknots. In their absence, it
            gracefully degrades to the same polynomial
            algorithm. A prototypical implementation
            demonstrates the applicability of the method.}
