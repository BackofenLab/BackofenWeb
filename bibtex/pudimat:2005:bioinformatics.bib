abstract = {Motivation: The identification of transcription
            factor binding sites in promoter sequences is an
            important problem, since it reveals information
            about the transcriptional regulation of genes. For
            analysing transcriptional regulation, computational
            approaches for predicting putative binding sites are
            applied. Commonly used stochastic models for binding
            sites are position specific score matrices (PSSM),
            which show weak predictive power. Results: We have
            developed a probabilistic modelling approach which
            allows to consider diverse characteristic binding
            site properties to obtain more accurate
            representations of binding sites. These properties
            are modelled as random variables in Bayesian
            networks, which are capable to deal with
            dependencies amongbinding site properties. Cross
            validation on several data sets shows improvements
            in the false positive error rate and the
            significance (p-value) of true binding
            sites. Availability: A more extensive description of
            validation results are available at
