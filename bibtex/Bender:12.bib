abstract = {We studied intra-annual wood density profiles of Douglas-fir tree rings (Pseudotsuga menziesii
            [Mirb.] Franco) in southwestern Germany. Growth rate varies differently over time throughout the
            circumference of trees. This leads to differences in wood formation, which can be observed in the
            shape of the density profiles of the same tree ring measured in different radial directions. Due to this
            spatial variation in density profiles, we need a reliable method to determine an average profile,
            which preserves the common characteristics of the data. To this end, we developed a multiple
            interval-based curve alignment (MICA) procedure. It identifies characteristic points within the
            profiles such as minima, maxima and inflection points. These reference points are shifted gradually
            against each other within a proportionally defined base line interval. Using our progressive alignment
            approach, we are able to calculate an average profile that represents very well the characteristics of
            all measured curves of a specific tree ring. We applied the procedure to get year-specific average
            profiles using various trees. This results in representative mean density profiles that preserves the
            density variations common to all aligned profiles. Individual noise is reduced thereby enabling the
            analysis of the impact of weather variations on wood density.}
