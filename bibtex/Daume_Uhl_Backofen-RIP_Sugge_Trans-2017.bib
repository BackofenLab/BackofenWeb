abstract = {L7Ae is a universal archaeal protein that recognizes and 
            stabilizes kink-turn (k-turn) motifs in RNA substrates. 
            These structural motifs are widespread in nature and are 
            found in many functional RNA species, including ribosomal 
            RNAs. Synthetic biology approaches utilize L7Ae/k-turn 
            interactions to control gene expression in eukaryotes. Here, 
            we present results of comprehensive RNA immunoprecipitation 
            sequencing (RIP-Seq) analysis of genomically tagged L7Ae 
            from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus 
            acidocaldarius A large set of interacting noncoding RNAs was 
            identified. In addition, several mRNAs, including the l7ae 
            transcript, were found to contain k-turn motifs that 
            facilitate L7Ae binding. In vivo studies showed that L7Ae 
            autoregulates the translation of its mRNA by binding to a 
            k-turn motif present in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). A 
            green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system was 
            established in Escherichia coli and verified conservation of 
            L7Ae-mediated feedback regulation in Archaea Mobility shift 
            assays confirmed binding to a k-turn in the transcript of 
            nop5-fibrillarin, suggesting that the expression of all C/D 
            box sRNP core proteins is regulated by L7Ae. These studies 
            revealed that L7Ae-mediated gene regulation evolved in 
            archaeal organisms, generating new tools for the modulation 
            of synthetic gene circuits in bacteria.IMPORTANCE L7Ae is an 
            essential archaeal protein that is known to structure 
            ribosomal RNAs and small RNAs (sRNAs) by binding to their 
            kink-turn motifs. Here, we utilized RIP-Seq methodology to 
            achieve a first global analysis of RNA substrates for L7Ae. 
            Several novel interactions with noncoding RNA molecules 
            (e.g., with the universal signal recognition particle RNA) 
            were discovered. In addition, L7Ae was found to bind to 
            mRNAs, including its own transcript's 5' untranslated 
            region. This feedback-loop control is conserved in most 
            archaea and was incorporated into a reporter system that was 
            utilized to control gene expression in bacteria. These 
            results demonstrate that L7Ae-mediated gene regulation 
            evolved originally in archaeal organisms. The 
            feedback-controlled reporter gene system can easily be 
            adapted for synthetic biology approaches that require strict 
            gene expression control.}
