abstract = {A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a common statistical
            model which is widely used for analysis of
            biological sequence data and other sequential
            phenomena In the present paper we extend HMMs with
            constraints and show how the familiar Viterbi
            algorithm can be generalized, based on constraint
            solving methods. HMMs with constraints have
            advantages over traditional ones in terms of more
            compact expressions as well as opportunities for
            pruning during Viterbi computations. We exemplify
            this by an enhancement of simple prokaryote gene
            finder given by an HMM.}
