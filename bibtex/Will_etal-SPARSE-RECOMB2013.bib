abstract = {Motivation: There is increasing evidence of
            pervasive transcription, resulting in hundreds of
            thousands of ncRNAs of unknown function. Standard
            computational analysis tasks for inferring
            functional annotations like clustering require fast
            and accurate RNA comparisons based on sequence and
            structure similarity.  The gold standard for the
            latter is Sankoff’s algorithm, which simultaneously
            aligns and folds RNAs. Because of its extreme time
            complexity of $O(n^6)$, numerous faster
            "Sankoff-style" approaches have been
            suggested. Several such approaches introduce
            heuristics based on sequence alignment, which
            compromises the alignment quality for RNAs with
            sequence identities below $60\%$. Avoiding such
            heuristics, as e.g. in LocARNA, has been assumed to
            prohibit time complexities better than $O(n^4)$,
            which strongly limits large-scale applications.
            Results: Breaking this barrier, we introduce SPARSE
            (Sparse Prediction and Alignment of RNAs using
            Structure Ensembles), a novel quadratic time
            Sankoff-style approach that does not rely on
            sequence-based heuristics but employs structural
            properties of RNA ensembles; its $O(n^2)$ complexity
            matches the one of sequence alignment. The approach
            is based on a novel lightweight Sankoff-style
            alignment model, for which we introduce the
            algorithm PARSE. For the first time it transfers the
            Sankoff-model completely to a lightweight energy
            model; thus, it is more expressive than all previous
            lightweight methods, which inherit the PMcomp
            model. In comparison to LocARNA and similar
            approaches, the novel model enables much stronger
            sparsification based on the RNA structure ensemble;
            consequently, SPARSE aligns and folds RNAs with
            similar alignment and better folding quality in
            significantly less time. Finally, SPARSE aligns
            ncRNAs from the challenging low sequence identity
            region more accurately than tools relying on
            sequence-based heuristics.  Conclusion: Our results
            indicate that a complete lightweight Sankoff-style
            model with stronger sparsification can increase the
            performance and accuracy of RNA alignment, where the
            potential of the model points far beyond the studied
            prototype. Not falling back on sequence comparison,
            SPARSE suggests itself for large scale similarity
            assessment of RNAs with moderate to very low
            sequence identity.}
