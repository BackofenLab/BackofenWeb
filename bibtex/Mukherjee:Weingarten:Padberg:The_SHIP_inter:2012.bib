abstract = {The SH2-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase, SHIP1, 
            negatively regulates signal transduction from the B cell 
            antigen receptor (BCR). The mode of coupling between SHIP1 
            and the BCR has not been elucidated so far. In comparison to 
            wild-type cells, B cells expressing a mutant IgD- or IgM-BCR 
            containing a C-terminally truncated Ig-alpha respond to 
            pervanadate stimulation with markedly reduced tyrosine 
            phosphorylation of SHIP1 and augmented activation of protein 
            kinase B. This indicates that SHIP1 is capable of 
            interacting with the C-terminus of Ig-alpha. Employing a 
            system of fluorescence resonance energy transfer in S2 
            cells, we can clearly demonstrate interaction between the 
            SH2-domain of SHIP1 and Ig-alpha. Furthermore, a 
            fluorescently labeled SH2-domain of SHIP1 translocates to 
            the plasma membrane in an Ig-alpha-dependent manner. 
            Interestingly, whereas the SHIP1 SH2-domain can be 
            pulled-down with phospho-peptides corresponding to the 
            immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of 
            Ig-alpha from detergent lysates, no interaction between 
            full-length SHIP1 and the phosphorylated Ig-alpha ITAM can 
            be observed. Further studies show that the SH2-domain of 
            SHIP1 can bind to the C-terminus of the SHIP1 molecule, most 
            probably by inter- as well as intra-molecular means, and 
            that this interaction regulates the association between 
            different forms of SHIP1 and Ig-alpha.}
