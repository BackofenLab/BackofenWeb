abstract = {We present the first algorithm for exact protein
            structure prediction in the FCC-HP-model. FCC-HP is
            a simplified protein model on the
            face-centered-cubic lattice (FCC) that models the
            main force of protein folding, namely the
            hydrophobic force (as Dill's HP-model,
            Dill. Biochemistry 1985) ...}
