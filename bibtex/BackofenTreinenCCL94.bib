abstract = {features given by Smolka & Treinen 1992 is
            complete. In contrast to other completeness proofs
            that have been given in this field, we employ the
            method of Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Games. The result
            extends previous results on complete axiomatizations
            of rational trees in the language of constructor
            equations (Comon & Lescanne 1988, Maher 1988) or in
            a weaker feature language as given by Backofen &
            Smolka 1993.}
