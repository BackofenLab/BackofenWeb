abstract = {We present a generic, problem independent algorithm for
            exploration of the lowenergy portion of the energy landscape
            of discrete systems and apply it to the energy landscape of
            lattice proteins. Starting from a set of optimal and
            near-optimal conformations derived from a constraint-based
            search technique, we are able to selectively investigate the
            lower part of lattice protein energy landscapes in two and
            three dimensions. This novel approach allows, in contrast to
            exhaustive enumeration, for an eOEcient calculation of
            optimal and near-optimal structures below a given energy
            threshold and is only limited by the available amount of
            memory. A straightforward application of the algorithm is
            calculation of barrier trees (representing the energy
            landscape), which then allows dynamics studies based on
            landscape theory.}
