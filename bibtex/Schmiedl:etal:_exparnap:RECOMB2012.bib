abstract = {ExpaRNA's core algorithm computes, for two fixed RNA
            structures, a maximal non-overlapping set of maximal
            exact matchings. We introduce an algorithm ExpaRNA-P
            that solves the lifted problem of finding such sets
            of exact matchings in entire Boltzmann-distributed
            structure ensembles of two RNAs. Due to a novel kind
            of structural sparsification, the new algorithm
            maintains the time and space complexity of the
            algorithm for fixed input structures. Furthermore,
            we generalized the chaining algorithm of ExpaRNA in
            order to compute a compatible subset of ExpaRNA-P's
            exact matchings.We show that ExpaRNA-P outperforms
            ExpaRNA in BRAliBase 2.1 benchmarks, where we pass
            the chained exact matchings as anchor constraints to
            the RNA alignment tool LocARNA.  Compared to
            LocARNA, this novel approach shows similar accuracy
            but is six times faster.}
