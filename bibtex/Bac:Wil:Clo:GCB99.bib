abstract = {Though the electrostatic, ionic, van der Waals,
            Lennard-Jones, hydrogen bonding, and other forces
            play an important role in the energy function
            minimized at a protein's native state, it is widely
            believed that the {\em hydrophobic force} is the
            dominant term in protein folding.  In this paper, we
            attempt to quantify the extent to which the
            hydrophobic force determines the positions of the
            backbone $\alpha$-carbon atoms in PDB data, by
            applying Monte-Carlo and genetic algorithms to
            determine the predicted conformation with minimum
            energy, where only the hydrophobic force is
            considered (i.e. Dill's HP-model, and refinements
            using Woese's polar requirement).  This is done by
            computing the root mean square deviation between the
            normalized distance matrix $D = (d_{i,j})$
            ($d_{i,j}$ is normalized Euclidean distance between
            residues $r_i$ and $r_j$) for PDB data with that
            obtained from the output of our algorithms. Our
            program was run on the database of ancient conserved
            regions drawn from GenBank 101 generously supplied
            by W. Gilbert's lab, as well as medium-sized
            proteins (E. Coli RecA, {\tt 2reb}, Erythrocruorin,
            {\tt 1eca}, and Actinidin {\tt 2act}). The root mean
            square deviation (RMSD) between distance matrices
            derived from the PDB data and from our program
            output is quite small, and by comparison with RMSD
            between PDB data and random coils, allows a
            quantification of the hydrophobic force contribution
            The final version of this paper will appear in the
            proceedings of PSB'2000.  Keywords: lattice,
            face-centered-cubic, hydrophobic force,
            automorphism}
