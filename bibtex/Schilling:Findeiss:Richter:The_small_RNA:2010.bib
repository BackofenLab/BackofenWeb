abstract = {Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are key players in 
            prokaryotic metabolic circuits, allowing the cell to adapt 
            to changing environmental conditions. Regulatory 
            interference by sRNAs in cellular metabolism is often 
            facilitated by the Sm-like protein Hfq. A search for novel 
            sRNAs in A. baylyi intergenic regions was performed by a 
            biocomputational screening. One candidate, Aar, encoded 
            between trpS and sucD showed Hfq dependency in Northern blot 
            analysis. Aar was expressed strongly during stationary 
            growth phase in minimal medium; in contrast, in complex 
            medium, strongest expression was in the exponential growth 
            phase. Whereas over-expression of Aar in trans did not 
            affect bacterial growth, seven mRNA targets predicted by two 
            in silico approaches were upregulated in stationary growth 
            phase. All seven mRNAs are involved in A. baylyi amino acid 
            metabolism. A putative binding site for Lrp, the global 
            regulator of branched-chain amino acids in E. coli, was 
            observed within the aar gene. Both facts imply an Aar 
            participation in amino acid metabolism.}
