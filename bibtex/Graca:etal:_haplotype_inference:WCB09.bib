  abstract =	 {Haplotype inference is a crucial topic in genetic
                  studies and also repre-sents a challenging
                  computational problem. A significant number of
                  combinatorial approaches tackle the haplotype
                  inference problem either for pedigrees or for
                  unrelatedindividuals.  This work integrates two
                  relevant and well-known constraint based haplotyping
                  approaches. The Minimum Recombinant Haplotyping
                  Configuration (MRHC)problem targets the haplotyping
                  solution which minimizes the number of recombinant
                  events within a pedigree. MRHC only takes into
                  consideration the family information.In contrast,
                  the Haplotype Inference by Pure Parsimony (HIPP)
                  problem aims at finding a solution which minimizes
                  the number of distinct haplotypes. The HIPP
                  approachis adequate for phasing unrelated
                  individuals from the same population. This paper
                  proposes a method for inferring haplotypes for
                  individuals of the same population,although
                  organized in different families, thus combining both
                  MRHC and HIPP approaches.  This new method can take
                  into account family information and
                  populationinformation, both important in haplotype
                  inference.  Experimental results show that the
                  proposed approach is more accurate, both in terms of
                  switch error rate and miss-ing error rate, than the
                  MRHC approach (performed by the PedPhase tool), on
                  sets of families from the same population.}
