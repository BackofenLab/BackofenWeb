abstract = {Noncoding RNAs have emerged as important key players in the 
            cell. Understanding their surprisingly diverse range of 
            functions is challenging for experimental and computational 
            biology. Here, we review computational methods to analyze 
            noncoding RNAs. The topics covered include basic and 
            advanced techniques to predict RNA structures, annotation of 
            noncoding RNAs in genomic data, mining RNA-seq data for 
            novel transcripts and prediction of transcript structures, 
            computational aspects of microRNAs, and database resources.
