            Due to novel experimental methods on the genomic scale, biologists are
            struggling with ever increasing magnitudes of data that can, in many cases,
            only be harnessed by previous bioinformatics analyses. Currently many tools
            are either only accessible on the command line and web servers tend to lack
            easy usability. The Freiburg RNA Tools webserver aims at supplying an easy
            to use and comprehensive web resource for RNA analysis, also for nonadept
            users. We designed a webserver framework that simplifies the access
            to our RNA analysis tools. The tools are accompanied by extensive help
            pages and direct help requests are rapidly answered. All tools incorporate
            individual post processing steps that aid result interpretation. The results can
            be viewed in the browser and/or downloaded for further local analysis or
            archiving. Individual job descriptions can be entered by the user, thus
            alleviating personal online archiving. Furthermore, results are stored for 30
            days. The Freiburg RNA tools webserver currently integrates eight tools for
            RNA analysis. It includes CopraRNA (sRNA target prediction), LocARNA
            (alignment and folding), CARNA (ensemble alignment), MARNA
            (structure alignment), ExpaRNA (exact matching), INFORNA (sequence
            design), IntaRNA (RNA-RNA interaction) and CRISPRmap (CRISPR
            conservation). The addition of several further tools is under construction.
            The tools are available at: http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de.}
