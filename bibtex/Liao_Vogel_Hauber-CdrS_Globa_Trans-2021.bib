abstract = {Transcriptional regulators that integrate cellular and 
            environmental signals to control cell division are well 
            known in bacteria and eukaryotes, but their existence is 
            poorly understood in archaea. We identified a conserved gene 
            (cdrS) that encodes a small protein and is highly 
            transcribed in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The 
            cdrS gene could not be deleted, but CRISPR interference 
            (CRISPRi)-mediated repression of the cdrS gene caused slow 
            growth and cell division defects and changed the expression 
            of multiple genes and their products associated with cell 
            division, protein degradation, and metabolism. Consistent 
            with this complex regulatory network, overexpression of cdrS 
            inhibited cell division, whereas overexpression of the 
            operon encoding both CdrS and a tubulin-like cell division 
            protein (FtsZ2) stimulated division. Chromatin 
            immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified 18 
            DNA-binding sites of the CdrS protein, including one 
            upstream of the promoter for a cell division gene, ftsZ1, 
            and another upstream of the essential gene dacZ, encoding 
            diadenylate cyclase involved in c-di-AMP signaling, which is 
            implicated in the regulation of cell division. These 
            findings suggest that CdrS is a transcription factor that 
            plays a central role in a regulatory network coordinating 
            metabolism and cell division. IMPORTANCE Cell division is a 
            central mechanism of life and is essential for growth and 
            development. Members of the Bacteria and Eukarya have 
            different mechanisms for cell division, which have been 
            studied in detail. In contrast, cell division in members of 
            the Archaea is still understudied, and its regulation is 
            poorly understood. Interestingly, different cell division 
            machineries appear in members of the Archaea, with the 
            Euryarchaeota using a cell division apparatus based on the 
            tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, as in bacteria. 
            Here, we identify the small protein CdrS as essential for 
            survival and a central regulator of cell division in the 
            euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. CdrS also appears to 
            coordinate other cellular pathways, including synthesis of 
            signaling molecules and protein degradation. Our results 
            show that CdrS plays a sophisticated role in cell division, 
            including regulation of numerous associated genes. These 
            findings are expected to initiate investigations into 
            conditional regulation of division in archaea.}
