abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
            (CRISPR) and their associated proteins (Cas) are essential 
            genetic elements in many archaeal and bacterial genomes, 
            playing a key role in a prokaryote adaptive immune system 
            against invasive foreign elements. In recent years, the 
            CRISPR-Cas system has also been engineered to facilitate 
            target gene editing in eukaryotic genomes. Bioinformatics 
            played an essential role in the detection and analysis of 
            CRISPR systems and here we review the bioinformatics-based 
            efforts that pushed the field of CRISPR-Cas research 
            further. We discuss the bioinformatics tools that have been 
            published over the last few years and, finally, present the 
            most popular tools for the design of CRISPR-Cas9 guides.}
