abstract = {Uptake of foreign mobile genetic elements is often 
            detrimental and can result in cell death. For protection 
            against invasion, prokaryotes have developed several defence 
            mechanisms, which take effect at all stages of infection; an 
            example is the recently discovered CRISPR (clustered 
            regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas 
            (CRISPR-associated) immune system. This defence system 
            directly degrades invading genetic material and is present 
            in almost all archaea and many bacteria. Current data 
            indicate a large variety of mechanistic molecular 
            approaches. Although almost all archaea carry this defence 
            weapon, only a few archaeal systems have been fully 
            characterized. In the present paper, we summarize the 
            prerequisites for the detection and degradation of invaders 
            in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. H. volcanii 
            encodes a subtype I-B CRISPR-Cas system and the defence can 
            be triggered by a plasmid-based invader. Six different 
            target-interference motifs are recognized by the Haloferax 
            defence and a 9-nt non-contiguous seed sequence is 
            essential. The repeat sequence has the potential to fold 
            into a minimal stem-loop structure, which is conserved in 
            haloarchaea and might be recognized by the Cas6 
            endoribonuclease during the processing of CRISPR loci into 
            mature crRNA (CRISPR RNA). Individual crRNA species were 
            present in very different concentrations according to an 
            RNA-Seq analysis and many were unable to trigger a 
            successful defence reaction. Recognition of the plasmid 
            invader does not depend on its copy number, but instead 
            results indicate a dependency on the type of origin present 
            on the plasmid.}
