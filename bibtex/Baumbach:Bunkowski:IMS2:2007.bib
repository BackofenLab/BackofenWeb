abstract = {IMS2 is an Integrated Medical Software system for the analysis 
            of Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS) data. It assists medical 
            staff with the following IMS data processing steps: 
            acquisition, visualization, classification, and annotation. 
            IMS2 provides data analysis and interpretation features on the 
            one hand, and also helps to improve the classification by increasing 
            the number of the pre-classified datasets on the other hand. It is 
            designed to facilitate early detection of lung cancer, one of the most 
            common cancer types with one million deaths each year around the world. 
            After reviewing the IMS technology, we first describe the software 
            architecture of IMS2 and then the integrated classification module, 
            including necessary pre-processing steps and different classification 
            methods. The Lung Hospital Hemer (Germany) provided IMS data of 35 
            patients suffering from lung cancer and 72 samples of healthy persons. 
            IMS2 correctly classifies 99% of the samples, evaluated using 10-fold 
            cross-validation.}
