abstract = {RNA binding proteins and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) assemble 
            into ribonucleoprotein granules that regulate mRNA 
            trafficking, local translation, and turnover. The 
            dysregulation of RNA-protein condensation disturbs synaptic 
            plasticity and neuron survival and has been widely 
            associated with human neurological disease. Neuronal 
            granules are thought to condense around particular proteins 
            that dictate the identity and composition of each granule 
            type. Here, we show in Drosophila that a previously 
            uncharacterized long noncoding RNA, mimi, is required to 
            scaffold large neuronal granules in the adult nervous 
            system. Neuronal ELAV-like proteins directly bind mimi and 
            mediate granule assembly, while Staufen maintains condensate 
            integrity. mimi granules contain mRNAs and proteins involved 
            in synaptic processes; granule loss in mimi mutant flies 
            impairs nervous system maturity and neuropeptide-mediated 
            signaling and causes phenotypes of neurodegeneration. Our 
            work reports an architectural RNA for a neuronal granule and 
            provides a handle to interrogate functions of a condensate 
            independently of those of its constituent proteins.}
