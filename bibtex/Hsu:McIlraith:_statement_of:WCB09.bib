abstract = {Here the authors overview an ongoing effort to
            extend satisfiabilitybased methods for haplotype
            inference by pure parsimony (HIPP). This genome
            analysis task, first formulated as a boolean
            satisfiability probelm by Lynce and Marques-Silva
            [1], has been performed successfully by modern
            SAT-Solvers. But, it is not as widely used as some
            better-publicized statistical tools, such as PHASE
            [2]. This paper presents the authors' assessment of
            the current situation, and a preliminary statement
            of intention concerning their aims in this
            area. Namely, the situation suggests three
            categories of improvements for making HIPP more
            widely-used within the biological community: 1) the
            ability to handle larger problems; 2) more detailed
            empirical understanding of the accuracy of the "pure
            parsimony" criterion; and 3) additional criteria and
            methods for improving on this level of accuracy.}
