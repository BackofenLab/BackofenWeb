abstract = {Recent genome-wide computational screens that search
            for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole
            genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of
            structural non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity
            of such approaches, however, is limited due to their
            reliance on sequence-based whole- genome aligners,
            which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This
            suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain
            undetected. Structure-based align- ment, which could
            increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for
            genome- wide screens due to its extreme
            computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we
            present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for de novo
            Prediction of structural ncRNA) that realigns whole
            genomes based on RNA sequence and structure and then
            evaluates the realignments for potential structural
            ncRNAs with a ncRNA predictor such as RNAz 2.0. For
            efficiency of the pipeline, we develop a novel
            banding realignment algorithm for the RNA multiple
            alignment tool LocARNA.  This allows us to perform
            very fast structure-based realignment within limited
            deviation of the original multiple alignment from
            the WGA. We apply REAPR to the complete twelve
            Drosophila WGAs to predict ncRNAs across all these
            Drosophila species. Compared to direct prediction
            from the original WGA at the same False Discovery
            Rate (FDR), we predict twice as many high-confidence
            ncRNA candidates in D.melanogaster while less than
            doubling the run-time. As a novelty in ncRNA
            prediction, we control the FDR, going beyond the
            usual a posteriori FDR estimation. Applying the
            sequence-based alignment tool Muscle for
            realignment, we demonstrate that structure-based
            methods are necessary for effective prediction of
            originally misaligned ncRNAs. Comparing to recent
            screens of Drosophila and ENCODE we show that REAPR
            outperforms the widely-used de novo predictors RNAz,
            EvoFold, and CMfinder. Finally, we reveal, with high
            confidence, a putative structural motif in the long
            ncRNA roX1 of D.melanogaster, known to regulate X
            chromosome dosage compensation in male
            ies. Interestingly, we recapitulate the Drosophila
            phylogeny, based on co-predicted ncRNAs across all
            genomes.}
