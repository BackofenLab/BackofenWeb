abstract = {Mechanisms adjusting replication initiation and cell cycle 
            progression in response to environmental conditions are 
            crucial for microbial survival. Functional characterization 
            of the trans-encoded small non-coding RNA (trans-sRNA) EcpR1 
            in the plant-symbiotic alpha-proteobacterium Sinorhizobium 
            meliloti revealed a role of this class of riboregulators in 
            modulation of cell cycle regulation. EcpR1 is broadly 
            conserved in at least five families of the Rhizobiales and 
            is predicted to form a stable structure with two defined 
            stem-loop domains. In S. meliloti, this trans-sRNA is 
            encoded downstream of the divK-pleD operon. ecpR1 belongs to 
            the stringent response regulon, and its expression was 
            induced by various stress factors and in stationary phase. 
            Induced EcpR1 overproduction led to cell elongation and 
            increased DNA content, while deletion of ecpR1 resulted in 
            reduced competitiveness. Computationally predicted EcpR1 
            targets were enriched with cell cycle-related mRNAs. 
            Post-transcriptional repression of the cell cycle key 
            regulatory genes gcrA and dnaA mediated by mRNA base-pairing 
            with the strongly conserved loop 1 of EcpR1 was 
            experimentally confirmed by two-plasmid differential gene 
            expression assays and compensatory changes in sRNA and mRNA. 
            Evidence is presented for EcpR1 promoting RNase E-dependent 
            degradation of the dnaA mRNA. We propose that EcpR1 
            contributes to modulation of cell cycle regulation under 
            detrimental conditions.}
