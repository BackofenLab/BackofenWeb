abstract = {We examine the existential fragment of a feature logic, which is
            extended by regular path expressions.  A regular path expression is a
            subterm relation, where the set of allowed paths for the subterms is
            restricted to any given regular language. In the area of computational
            linguistics, this notion has been introduced as ``functional
            uncertainty''.  We will prove that satisfiability is decidable by
            constructing a quasi-terminating rule system.}
