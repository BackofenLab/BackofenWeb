abstract = {Noncoding RNAs that are-like mRNAs-spliced, capped, and 
            polyadenylated have important functions in cellular 
            processes. The inventory of these mRNA-like noncoding RNAs 
            (mlncRNAs), however, is incomplete even in well-studied 
            organisms, and so far, no computational methods exist to 
            predict such RNAs from genomic sequences only. The subclass 
            of these transcripts that is evolutionarily conserved 
            usually has conserved intron positions. We demonstrate here 
            that a genome-wide comparative genomics approach searching 
            for short conserved introns is capable of identifying 
            conserved transcripts with a high specificity. Our approach 
            requires neither an open reading frame nor substantial 
            sequence or secondary structure conservation in the 
            surrounding exons. Thus it identifies spliced transcripts in 
            an unbiased way. After applying our approach to insect 
            genomes, we predict 369 introns outside annotated coding 
            transcripts, of which 131 are confirmed by expressed 
            sequence tags (ESTs) and/or noncoding FlyBase transcripts. 
            Of the remaining 238 novel introns, about half are 
            associated with protein-coding genes-either extending coding 
            or untranslated regions or likely belonging to unannotated 
            coding genes. The remaining 129 introns belong to novel 
            mlncRNAs that are largely unstructured. Using RT-PCR, we 
            verified seven of 12 tested introns in novel mlncRNAs and 11 
            of 17 introns in novel coding genes. The expression level of 
            all verified mlncRNA transcripts is low but varies during 
            development, which suggests regulation. As conserved introns 
            indicate both purifying selection on the exon-intron 
            structure and conserved expression of the transcript in 
            related species, the novel mlncRNAs are good candidates for 
            functional transcripts.}
