abstract = {Selenocysteine is the 21th amino acid, which occurs in all 
            kingdoms of life. Selenocysteine is encoded by the 
            STOP-codon UGA. For its insertion, it requires a specific 
            mRNA sequence downstream the UGA-codon that forms a hairpin 
            like structure (called Sec insertion sequence (SECIS)). We 
            consider the computational problem of generating new amino 
            acid sequences containing selenocysteine. This requires to 
            find an mRNA sequence that is similar to the 
            SECIS-consensus, is able to form the secondary structure 
            required for selenocysteine insertion, and whose translation 
            is maximally similar to the original amino acid sequence. We 
            show that the problem can be solved in linear time when 
            considering the hairpin-like SECIS-structure (and, more 
            generally, when considering a structure that does not 
            contain pseudoknots).}
