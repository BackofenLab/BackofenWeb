abstract = {Post-transcriptional gene regulation is a fundamental step 
            for coordinating cellular response in a variety of 
            processes. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs 
            (miRNAs) are the most important factors responsible for this 
            regulation. Here we report that different components of the 
            miR-200 family are involved in c-Jun mRNA regulation with 
            the opposite effect. While miR-200b inhibits c-Jun protein 
            production, miR-200a tends to increase the JUN amount 
            through a stabilization of its mRNA. This action is 
            dependent on the presence of the RBP HuR that binds the 
            3'UTR of c-Jun mRNA in a region including the mir-200a 
            binding site. The position of the binding site is 
            fundamental; by mutating this site, we demonstrate that the 
            effect is not micro-RNA specific. These results indicate 
            that miR-200a triggers a microRNA-mediated stabilization of 
            c-Jun mRNA, promoting the binding of HuR with c-Jun mRNA. 
            This is the first example of a positive regulation exerted 
            by a microRNA on an important oncogene in proliferating 
            cells.}
