            This  paper  contributes  to  the  formal  theory  of  dependency  grammar.  We  apply  the  classical  concept  of  algebraic  recognizability  to  characterize  regular  sets  of  dependency  structures,  and  show  how  in  this  framework,  two  empirically  relevant  structural  restrictions  on  dependency  analyses  yield  infinite  hierarchies  of  ever  more  expressive  string  languages.}
