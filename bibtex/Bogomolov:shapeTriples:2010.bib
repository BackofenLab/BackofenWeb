abstract = {The ability of some RNA molecules to switch between different
            metastable conformations plays an important role in cellular processes. In order to identify such molecules and to predict their conformational
            changes one has to investigate the refolding pathways. As a qualitative measure of these transitions, the barrier height
            marks the energy peak along such refolding paths. We introduce a
            meta-heuristic to estimate such barriers, which is an NP-complete
            problem. To guide an arbitrary path heuristic, the method uses
            RNA shape representative structures as intermediate checkpoints
            for detours. This enables a broad but estimationcient search for refolding
            pathways. The resulting Shape Triples meta-heuristic enables
            a close to optimal estimation of the barrier height that outperforms
            the precision of the employed path heuristic.}
