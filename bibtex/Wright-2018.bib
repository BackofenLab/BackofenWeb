abstract = {Many years of research in RNA biology have soundly established 
            the importance of RNA based regulation far beyond most early traditional 
            presumptions. Importantly, the advances in "wet" laboratory techniques 
            have produced unprecedented amounts of data that require efficient 
            and precise computational analysis schemes and algorithms. Hence, many \textit{in silico}
            methods that attempt topological and functional classification 
            of novel putative RNA based regulators are available.
            In this review we technically outline thermodynamics-based standard RNA
            secondary structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction approaches that have proven valuable to the RNA research 
            community in the past and present. For these, we highlight their usability 
            with a special focus on prokaryotic organisms and also briefly mention 
            recent advances in whole genome interactomics and how this may
            influence the field of predictive RNA research.}
