abstract = {MOTIVATION: Predicting RNA-RNA interactions is essential 
            for determining the function of putative non-coding RNAs. 
            Existing methods for the prediction of interactions are all 
            based on single sequences. Since comparative methods have 
            already been useful in RNA structure determination, we 
            assume that conserved RNA-RNA interactions also imply 
            conserved function. Of these, we further assume that a 
            non-negligible amount of the existing RNA-RNA interactions 
            have also acquired compensating base changes throughout 
            evolution. We implement a method, PETcofold, that can take 
            covariance information in intra-molecular and 
            inter-molecular base pairs into account to predict 
            interactions and secondary structures of two multiple 
            alignments of RNA sequences. RESULTS: PETcofold's ability to 
            predict RNA-RNA interactions was evaluated on a carefully 
            curated dataset of 32 bacterial small RNAs and their 
            targets, which was manually extracted from the literature. 
            For evaluation of both RNA-RNA interaction and structure 
            prediction, we were able to extract only a few high-quality 
            examples: one vertebrate small nucleolar RNA and four 
            bacterial small RNAs. For these we show that the prediction 
            can be improved by our comparative approach. Furthermore, 
            PETcofold was evaluated on controlled data with 
            phylogenetically simulated sequences enriched for covariance 
            patterns at the interaction sites. We observed increased 
            performance with increased amounts of covariance.
