abstract = {Starting with the discovery of microRNAs and the advent of
            genome-wide transcriptomics, non-protein-coding transcripts
            have moved from a fringe topic to a central field research
            in molecular biology. In this contribution we review the
            state of the art of "computational RNomics", i.e., the
            bioinformatics approaches to genome-wide RNA
            annotation. Instead of rehashing results from recently
            published surveys in detail, we focus here on the open
            problem in the field, namely (functional) annotation of the
            plethora of putative RNAs. A series of exploratory studies
            are used to provide non-trivial examples for the discussion
            of some of the difficulties.}
