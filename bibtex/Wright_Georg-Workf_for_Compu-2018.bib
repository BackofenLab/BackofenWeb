abstract = {Computational methods can often facilitate the functional 
            characterization of individual sRNAs and furthermore allow 
            high-throughput analysis on large numbers of sRNA 
            candidates. This chapter outlines a potential workflow for 
            computational sRNA analyses and describes in detail methods 
            for homolog detection, target prediction, and functional 
            characterization based on enrichment analysis. The 
            cyanobacterial sRNA IsaR1 is used as a specific example. All 
            methods are available as webservers and easily accessible 
            for nonexpert users.}
