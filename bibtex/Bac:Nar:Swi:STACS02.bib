abstract = {We address the problem of finding an mRNA sequence
            satisfying the constraints posed by an input graph and
            associated functions which model bond structure and
            similarity requirements.  We show that the problem of
            deciding if an mRNA sequence exists, satisfying the
            given constraints, is NP-complete.  For a special
            class of well motivated input graphs we present
            polynomial time algorithms that solve the related
            optimization problem exactly.  Using this algorithm we
            design constant factor approximation algorithms for
            the more general case.}
