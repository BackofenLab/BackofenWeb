abstract = { Sequence-structure alignment of RNA with arbitrary secondary
            structure is Max-SNP-hard. Therefore, the problem of RNA alignment
            is commonly restricted to nested structure, where dynamic
            programming yields efficient solutions. However, nested structure
            cannot model pseudoknots or even more complex structural
            dependencies.  Nevertheless those dependencies are essential and
            conserved features of many RNAs. Only a few existing approaches deal
            with crossing structures. Here, we present a constraint approach for
            alignment of structures in the even more general class of unlimited
            structures.  Our central contribution is a new RNA alignment
            constraint propagator. It is based on an efficient $O(n^2)$
            relaxation of the RNA alignment problem. Our constraint-based
            approach Carna solves the alignment problem for sequences with given
            input structures of unlimited complexity. Carna is implemented using
            Gecode.}
