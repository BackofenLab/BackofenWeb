abstract = {Multiple alignments of RNAs are an essential prerequisite 
            to further analyses such as homology modeling, motif 
            description, or illustration of conserved or variable 
            binding sites. Beyond the comparison of RNAs on the sequence 
            level, structural conformations determined by basepairs have 
            to be taken into account. Several pairwise 
            sequence-structure alignment methods have been developed. 
            They use extended alignment scores that evaluate secondary 
            structure information in addition to sequence information. 
            However, two problems for the multiple alignment step 
            remain. First, how to combine pairwise sequence-structure 
            alignments into a multiple alignment and, second, how to 
            generate secondary structure information for sequences whose 
            structural information is missing. Here, we describe MARNA, 
            its underlying methods and its usage. MARNA is an approach 
            for multiple alignment of RNAs taking into considerations 
            both the primary sequences and the secondary structures. It 
            relies on the pairwise sequence-structure comparison 
            strategy by generating a set of weighted alignment edges. 
            This set is processed by a consistency-based multiple 
            alignment method. Additionally, MARNA extracts a 
            consensus-sequence and structure from this generated 
            multiple alignment. MARNA can be accessed via the 
            http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/MARNA.}
