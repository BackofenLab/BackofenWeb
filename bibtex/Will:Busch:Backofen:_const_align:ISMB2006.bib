abstract = {We revisit sequence comparison with side constraints. Often,
            when prior knowledge about the molecules is available, it is
            desirable to incorporate this information into the
            alignment. We introduce a constraint-based approach that
            allows for easy integration of various kinds of additional
            information while preserving the efficiency of dynamic
            programming.}
