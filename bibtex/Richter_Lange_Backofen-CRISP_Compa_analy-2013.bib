abstract = {The prokaryotic antiviral defense systems CRISPR (clustered 
            regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas 
            (CRISPR-associated) employs short crRNAs (CRISPR RNAs) to 
            target invading viral nucleic acids. A short spacer sequence 
            of these crRNAs can be derived from a viral genome and 
            recognizes a reoccurring attack of a virus via base 
            complementarity. We analyzed the effect of spacer sequences 
            on the maturation of crRNAs of the subtype I-B Methanococcus 
            maripaludis C5 CRISPR cluster. The responsible endonuclease, 
            termed Cas6b, bound non-hydrolyzable repeat RNA as a dimer 
            and mature crRNA as a monomer. Comparative analysis of Cas6b 
            processing of individual spacer-repeat-spacer RNA substrates 
            and crRNA stability revealed the potential influence of 
            spacer sequence and length on these parameters. Correlation 
            of these observations with the variable abundance of crRNAs 
            visualized by deep-sequencing analyses is discussed. 
            Finally, insertion of spacer and repeat sequences with 
            archaeal poly-T termination signals is suggested to be 
            prevented in archaeal CRISPR/Cas systems.}
