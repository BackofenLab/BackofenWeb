abstract = {Most of the known alternative splice events have been 
            detected by the comparison of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) 
            and cDNAs. However, not all splice events are represented in 
            EST databases since ESTs have several biases. Therefore, 
            non-EST based approaches are needed to extend our view of a 
            transcriptome. Here, we describe a novel method for the ab 
            initio prediction of alternative splice events that is 
            solely based on the annotation of Pfam domains. Furthermore, 
            we applied this approach in a genome-wide manner to all 
            human RefSeq transcripts and predicted a total of 321 exon 
            skipping and intron retention events. We show that this 
            method is very reliable as 78% (250 of 321) of our 
            predictions are confirmed by ESTs or cDNAs. Subsequent 
            analyses of splice events within Pfam domains revealed a 
            significant preference of alternative exon junctions to be 
            located at the protein surface and to avoid secondary 
            structure elements. Thus, splice events within Pfams are 
            probable to alter the structure and function of a domain 
            which makes them highly interesting for detailed biological 
            investigation. As Pfam domains are annotated in many other 
            species, our strategy to predict exon skipping and intron 
            retention events might be important for species with a lower 
            number of ESTs.}
