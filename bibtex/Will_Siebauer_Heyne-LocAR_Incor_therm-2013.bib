abstract = {BACKGROUND: The search for distant homologs has become an 
            import issue in genome annotation. A particular difficulty 
            is posed by divergent homologs that have lost recognizable 
            sequence similarity. This same problem also arises in the 
            recognition of novel members of large classes of RNAs such 
            as snoRNAsor microRNAs that consist of families unrelated by 
            common descent. Current homology search tools for structured 
            RNAs are either based entirely on sequence similarity (such 
            as blast or hmmer) or combine sequence and secondary 
            structure. The most prominent example of the latter class of 
            tools is Infernal. Alternatives are descriptor-based 
            methods. In most practical applications published to-date, 
            however, the information contained in covariance models or 
            manually prescribed search patterns is dominated by sequence 
            information. Here we ask two related questions: (1) Is 
            secondary structure alone informative for homology search 
            and the detection of novel members of RNA classes? (2) To 
            what extent is the thermodynamic propensity of the target 
            sequence to fold into the correct secondary structure 
            helpful for this task? RESULTS: Sequence-structure alignment 
            can be used as an alternative search strategy. In this 
            scenario, the query consists of a base pairing probability 
            matrix, which can be derived either from a single sequence 
            or from a multiple alignment representing a set of known 
            representatives. Sequence information can be optionally 
            added to the query. The target sequence is pre-processed to 
            obtain local base pairing probabilities. As a search engine 
            we devised a semi-global scanning variant of LocARNA's 
            algorithm for sequence-structure alignment. The LocARNAscan 
            tool is optimized for speed and low memory consumption. In 
            benchmarking experiments on artificial data we observe that 
            the inclusion of thermodynamic stability is helpful, albeit 
            only in a regime of extremely low sequence information in 
            the query. We observe, furthermore, that the sensitivity is 
            bounded in particular by the limited accuracy of the 
            predicted local structures of the target sequence. 
            CONCLUSIONS: Although we demonstrate that a purely 
            structure-based homology search is feasible in principle, it 
            is unlikely to outperform tools such as Infernal in most 
            application scenarios, where a substantial amount of 
            sequence information is typically available. The LocARNAscan 
            approach will profit, however, from high throughput methods 
            to determine RNA secondary structure. In transcriptomewide 
            applications, such methods will provide accurate structure 
            annotations on the target side. AVAILABILITY: Source code of
