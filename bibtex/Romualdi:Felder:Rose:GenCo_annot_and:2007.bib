abstract = {GenColors (gencolors.fli-leibniz.de) is a new web-based 
            software/database system aimed at an improved and 
            accelerated annotation of prokaryotic genomes considering 
            information on related genomes and making extensive use of 
            genome comparison. It offers a seamless integration of data 
            from ongoing sequencing projects and annotated genomic 
            sequences obtained from GenBank. A variety of export/import 
            filters manages an effective data flow from sequence 
            assembly and manipulation programs (e.g., GAP4) to GenColors 
            and back as well as to standard GenBank file(s). The genome 
            comparison tools include best bidirectional hits, gene 
            conservation, syntenies, and gene core sets. Precomputed 
            UniProt matches allow annotation and analysis in an 
            effective manner. In addition to these analysis options, 
            base-specific quality data (coverage and confidence) can 
            also be handled if available. The GenColors system can be 
            used both for annotation purposes in ongoing genome projects 
            and as an analysis tool for finished genomes. GenColors 
            comes in two types, as dedicated genome browsers and as the 
            Jena Prokaryotic Genome Viewer (JPGV). Dedicated genome 
            browsers contain genomic information on a set of related 
            genomes and offer a large number of options for genome 
            comparison. The system has been efficiently used in the 
            genomic sequencing of Borrelia garinii and is currently 
            applied to various ongoing genome projects on Borrelia, 
            Legionella, Escherichia, and Pseudomonas genomes. One of 
            these dedicated browsers, the Spirochetes Genome Browser 
            (sgb.fli-leibniz.de) with Borrelia, Leptospira, and 
            Treponema genomes, is freely accessible. The others will be 
            released after finalization of the corresponding genome 
            projects. JPGV (jpgv.fli-leibniz.de) offers information on 
            almost all finished bacterial genomes, as compared to the 
            dedicated browsers with reduced genome comparison 
            functionality, however. As of January 2006, this viewer 
            includes 632 genomic elements (e.g., chromosomes and 
            plasmids) of 293 species. The system provides versatile 
            quick and advanced search options for all currently known 
            prokaryotic genomes and generates circular and linear genome 
            plots. Gene information sheets contain basic gene 
            information, database search options, and links to external 
            databases. GenColors is also available on request for local 
            installation.}
