abstract = {Splice acceptors with the genomic NAGNAG motif may cause 
            NAG insertion-deletions in transcripts, occur in 30% of 
            human genes and are functional in at least 5% of human 
            genes. We found five significant biases indicating that 
            their distribution is nonrandom and that they are 
            evolutionarily conserved and tissue-specific. Because of 
            their subtle effects on mRNA and protein structures, these 
            splice acceptors are often overlooked or underestimated, but 
            they may have a great impact on biology and disease.}
