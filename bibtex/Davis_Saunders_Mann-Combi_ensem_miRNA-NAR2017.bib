abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of cell-fate 
            decisions in development and disease with a vast array of 
            target interactions that can be investigated using 
            computational approaches. For this study, we developed 
            metaMIR, a combinatorial approach to identify miRNAs that 
            co-regulate identified subsets of genes from a user-supplied 
            list. We based metaMIR predictions on an improved dataset of 
            human miRNA-target interactions, compiled using a 
            machine-learning-based meta-analysis of established 
            algorithms. Simultaneously, the inverse dataset of negative 
            interactions not likely to occur was extracted to increase 
            classifier performance, as measured using an expansive set 
            of experimentally validated interactions from a variety of 
            sources. In a second differential mode, candidate miRNAs are 
            predicted by indicating genes to be targeted and others to 
            be avoided to potentially increase specificity of results. 
            As an example, we investigate the neural crest, a transient 
            structure in vertebrate development where miRNAs play a 
            pivotal role. Patterns of metaMIR-predicted miRNA regulation 
            alone partially recapitulated functional relationships among 
            genes, and separate differential analysis revealed miRNA 
            candidates that would downregulate components implicated in 
            cancer progression while not targeting tumour suppressors. 
            Such an approach could aid in therapeutic application of 
            miRNAs to reduce unintended effects. The utility is 
            available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/metaMIR/.}
