abstract = {Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are a class of structural RNAs
            that often regulate mRNA targets via post-transcriptional base pair
            interactions. In this study, we assessed the accessibility and conservation of
            the interaction sites and the influence of these features on genome-wide target
            predictions. For this purpose, we compiled a set of 71 experimentally verified
            sRNA-target pairs from \textit{Escherichia coli} and \textit{Salmonella}, and
            collected genome-wide information on 5'~untranslated regions of annotated genes.
            Then, features of the confirmed interactions were compared to a set of
            non-interactions.
            We found that the interaction sites both in sRNA and target are more accessible
            than in the negative data. Furthermore, interaction sites in the sRNAs, but not
            in the targets, show high sequence conservation. The base pairing between sRNA
            and target was not found to be generally conserved across more distantly related
            species. We then present two approaches to constrain the region of interaction
            initiation to (1) well-accessible regions in both interaction partners or (2)
            unstructured conserved sRNA regions derived from reliability profiles of
            multiple sRNA alignments. Using these constraints, genome-wide target
            predictions were improved in terms of specificity.}
