abstract = {The heart is a highly specialized organ with essential 
            function for the organism throughout life. The significance 
            of DNA methylation in shaping the phenotype of the heart 
            remains only partially known. Here we generate and analyse 
            DNA methylomes from highly purified cardiomyocytes of 
            neonatal, adult healthy and adult failing hearts. We 
            identify large genomic regions that are differentially 
            methylated during cardiomyocyte development and maturation. 
            Demethylation of cardiomyocyte gene bodies correlates 
            strongly with increased gene expression. Silencing of 
            demethylated genes is characterized by the polycomb mark 
            H3K27me3 or by DNA methylation. De novo methylation by DNA 
            methyltransferases 3A/B causes repression of fetal cardiac 
            genes, including essential components of the cardiac 
            sarcomere. Failing cardiomyocytes partially resemble 
            neonatal methylation patterns. This study establishes DNA 
            methylation as a highly dynamic process during postnatal 
            growth of cardiomyocytes and their adaptation to 
            pathological stress in a process tightly linked to gene 
            regulation and activity.}
