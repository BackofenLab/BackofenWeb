abstract = {Lattice protein models are used for hierarchical
            approaches to protein structure prediction, as well
            as for investigating principles of protein
            folding. So far, one has the problem that there
            exists no lattice that can model real protein
            conformations with good quality \emph{and} for which
            an efficient method to find native conformations is
            known. We present the first method for the
            FCC-HP-Model [Agarwala et al., JCB 97] that is
            capable of finding native conformations for
            real-sized HP-sequences. It has been shown [Park and
            Levitt, JMB 95] that the FCC lattice can model real
            protein conformations with coordinate root mean
            square deviation below 2 \AA. Our method uses a
            constraint-based approach. It works by first
            calculating maximally compact sets of points
            (hydrophobic cores), and then threading the given
            HP-sequence to the hydrophobic cores such that the
            core is occupied by H-monomers. }
