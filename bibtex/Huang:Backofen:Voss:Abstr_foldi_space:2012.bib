abstract = {RNA has many pivotal functions especially in the regulation 
            of gene expression by ncRNAs. Identification of their 
            structure is an important requirement for understanding 
            their function. Structure prediction alone is often 
            insufficient for this task, due to algorithmic problems, 
            parameter inaccuracies, and biological peculiarities. Among 
            the latter, there are base modifications, cotranscriptional 
            folding leading to folding traps, and conformational 
            switching as in the case of riboswitches. All these require 
            more in-depth analysis of the folding space. The major 
            drawback, which all methods have to cope with, is the 
            exponential growth of the folding space. Therefore, methods 
            are often limited in the sequence length they can analyze, 
            or they make use of heuristics, sampling, or abstraction. 
            Our approach adopts the abstraction strategy and remedies 
            some problems of existing methods. We introduce a 
            position-specific abstraction based on helices that we term 
            helix index shapes, or hishapes for short. Utilizing a 
            dynamic programming framework, we have implemented this 
            abstraction in the program RNAHeliCes. Furthermore, we 
            developed two hishape-based methods, one for energy barrier 
            estimation, called HiPath, and one for abstract structure 
            comparison, termed HiTed. We demonstrate the superior 
            performance of HiPath compared to other existing methods and 
            the competitive accuracy of HiTed. RNAHeliCes, together with 
            HiPath and HiTed, are available for download at
