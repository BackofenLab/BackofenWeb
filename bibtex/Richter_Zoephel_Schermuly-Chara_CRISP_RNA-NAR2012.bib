abstract = {The CRISPR arrays found in many bacteria and most archaea 
            are transcribed into a long precursor RNA that is processed 
            into small clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
            repeats (CRISPR) RNAs (crRNAs). These RNA molecules can 
            contain fragments of viral genomes and mediate, together 
            with a set of CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, the 
            prokaryotic immunity against viral attacks. CRISPR/Cas 
            systems are diverse and the Cas6 enzymes that process crRNAs 
            vary between different subtypes. We analysed CRISPR/Cas 
            subtype I-B and present the identification of novel Cas6 
            enzymes from the bacterial and archaeal model organisms 
            Clostridium thermocellum and Methanococcus maripaludis C5. 
            Methanococcus maripaludis Cas6b in vitro activity and 
            specificity was determined. Two complementary catalytic 
            histidine residues were identified. RNA-Seq analyses 
            revealed in vivo crRNA processing sites, crRNA abundance and 
            orientation of CRISPR transcription within these two 
            organisms. Individual spacer sequences were identified with 
            strong effects on transcription and processing patterns of a 
            CRISPR cluster. These effects will need to be considered for 
            the application of CRISPR clusters that are designed to 
            produce synthetic crRNAs.}
