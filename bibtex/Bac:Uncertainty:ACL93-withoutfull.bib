abstract = {We show that feature logic extended by functional uncertainty is
            decidable, even if one admits cyclic descriptions.
            We present an algorithm, which solves feature descriptions
            containing functional uncertainty in two phases, both phases using a set
            of deterministic and non-deterministic rewrite rules. We then
            compare our algorithm with the one of Kaplan and Maxwell,
            that does not cover cyclic feature descriptions. }
