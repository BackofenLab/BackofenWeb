abstract = {Current genomic screens for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) predict 
            a large number of genomic regions containing potential 
            structural ncRNAs. The analysis of these data requires 
            highly accurate prediction of ncRNA boundaries and 
            discrimination of promising candidate ncRNAs from weak 
            predictions. Existing methods struggle with these goals 
            because they rely on sequence-based multiple sequence 
            alignments, which regularly misalign RNA structure and 
            therefore do not support identification of structural 
            similarities. To overcome this limitation, we compute 
            columnwise and global reliabilities of alignments based on 
            sequence and structure similarity; we refer to these 
            structure-based alignment reliabilities as STARs. The 
            columnwise STARs of alignments, or STAR profiles, provide a 
            versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of 
            ncRNAs. In particular, we improve the boundary prediction of 
            the widely used ncRNA gene finder RNAz by a factor of 3 from 
            a median deviation of 47 to 13 nt. Post-processing RNAz 
            predictions, LocARNA-P's STAR score allows much stronger 
            discrimination between true- and false-positive predictions 
            than RNAz's own evaluation. The improved accuracy, in this 
            scenario increased from AUC 0.71 to AUC 0.87, significantly 
            reduces the cost of successive analysis steps. The 
            ready-to-use software tool LocARNA-P produces 
            structure-based multiple RNA alignments with associated 
            columnwise STARs and predicts ncRNA boundaries. We provide 
            additional results, a web server for LocARNA/LocARNA-P, and 
            the software package, including documentation and a pipeline 
            for refining screens for structural ncRNA, at
