abstract = {Awakening of zygotic transcription in animal embryos relies 
            on maternal pioneer transcription factors. The interplay of 
            global and specific functions of these proteins remains 
            poorly understood. Here, we analyze chromatin accessibility 
            and time-resolved transcription in single and double mutant 
            zebrafish embryos lacking pluripotency factors Pou5f3 and 
            Sox19b. We show that two factors modify chromatin in a 
            largely independent manner. We distinguish four types of 
            direct enhancers by differential requirements for Pou5f3 or 
            Sox19b. We demonstrate that changes in chromatin 
            accessibility of enhancers underlie the changes in zygotic 
            expression repertoire in the double mutants. Pou5f3 or 
            Sox19b promote chromatin accessibility of enhancers linked 
            to the genes involved in gastrulation and ventral fate 
            specification. The genes regulating mesendodermal and dorsal 
            fates are primed for activation independently of Pou5f3 and 
            Sox19b. Strikingly, simultaneous loss of Pou5f3 and Sox19b 
            leads to premature expression of genes, involved in 
            regulation of organogenesis and differentiation.}
