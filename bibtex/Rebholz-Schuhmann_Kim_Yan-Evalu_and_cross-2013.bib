abstract = {MOTIVATION: Biomedical entities, their identifiers and 
            names, are essential in the representation of biomedical 
            facts and knowledge. In the same way, the complete set of 
            biomedical and chemical terms, i.e. the biomedical "term 
            space" (the "Lexeome"), forms a key resource to achieve the 
            full integration of the scientific literature with 
            biomedical data resources: any identified named entity can 
            immediately be normalized to the correct database entry. 
            This goal does not only require that we are aware of all 
            existing terms, but would also profit from knowing all their 
            senses and their semantic interpretation (ambiguities, 
            nestedness). RESULT: This study compiles a resource for 
            lexical terms of biomedical interest in a standard format 
            (called "LexEBI"), determines the overall number of terms, 
            their reuse in different resources and the nestedness of 
            terms. LexEBI comprises references for protein and gene 
            entries and their term variants and chemical entities 
            amongst other terms. In addition, disease terms have been 
            identified from Medline and PubmedCentral and added to 
            LexEBI. Our analysis demonstrates that the baseforms of 
            terms from the different semantic types show only little 
            polysemous use. Nonetheless, the term variants of protein 
            and gene names (PGNs) frequently contain species mentions, 
            which should have been avoided according to protein 
            annotation guidelines. Furthermore, the protein and gene 
            entities as well as the chemical entities, both do comprise 
            enzymes leading to hierarchical polysemy, and a large 
            portion of PGNs make reference to a chemical entity. 
            Altogether, according to our analysis based on the Medline 
            distribution, 401,869 unique PGNs in the documents contain a 
            reference to 25,022 chemical entities, 3,125 disease terms 
            or 1,576 species mentions. CONCLUSION: LexEBI delivers the 
            complete biomedical and chemical Lexeome in a standardized 
            representation (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rebholz-srv/LexEBI/). 
            The resource provides the disease terms as open source 
            content, and fully interlinks terms across resources.}
