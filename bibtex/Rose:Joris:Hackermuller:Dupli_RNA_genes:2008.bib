abstract = {Teleost fishes share a duplication of their entire genomes. 
            We report here on a computational survey of structured 
            non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in teleost genomes, focusing on the 
            fate of fish-specific duplicates. As in other metazoan 
            groups, we find evidence of a large number (11,543) of 
            structured RNAs, most of which (~86%) are clade-specific or 
            evolve so fast that their tetrapod homologs cannot be 
            detected. In surprising contrast to protein-coding genes, 
            the fish-specific genome duplication did not lead to a large 
            number of paralogous ncRNAs: only 188 candidates, mostly 
            microRNAs, appear in a larger copy number in teleosts than 
            in tetrapods, suggesting that large-scale gene duplications 
            do not play a major role in the expansion of the vertebrate 
            ncRNA inventory.}
