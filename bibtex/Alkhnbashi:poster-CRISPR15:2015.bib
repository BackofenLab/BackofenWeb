abstract = {Archaea and bacteria are known to acquire immunity against 
            invading viruses and plasmids through a widely conserved RNA interference pathway. 
            This mechanism involves non-coding RNAs that originate from genomic CRISPR loci and 
            interact with Cas proteins to form large ribonucleoprotein complexes which can target and 
            cleave invader nucleic acids in a sequence specific manner. Identification of CRISPR-Cas systems on 
            newly sequenced archeael and bacterial genomes involves the correct definition and classification of 
            both the coding and non-coding elements and this has always been challenging because of the high 
            diversity and modularity of the systems. Thus, existing automated tools give only a partial definition 
            of genomic CRISPR-Cas systems, and users are left to identify the remaining elements manually.
            We have developed a web-server called CRISPRloci for automated and comprehensive in silico characterization of 
            CRISPR-Cas systems on archaeal and bacterial genomes. The server integrates a series of tools in a seamless web interface featuring: 
            (i) accurate prediction of all CRISPR arrays in the correct orientation; (ii) definition of CRISPR leaders for each locus with 
            prediction of leader length using a machine learning method; (iii) annotation of cas genes and their unambiguous classification with 
            respect to the official subtype classification using an accurate k-nearest neighbor clustering technique. CRISPRloci visualizes the results 
            in an interactive genome map and includes the ability to zoom in and click for additional information. CRISPR arrays are also classified into 
            sequence families, or structural motifs, using our previous web-server CRISPRmap[1,2]. CRISPRloci constitutes a full suite for CRISPR-Cas system 
            characterization which offers annotation quality previously available only after manual inspection. 
            The web server can be accessed at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CRISPRloci.}
