abstract = {Lattice protein models are a major tool for investigating
            principles of protein folding. For this purpose, one needs an algorithm that
            is guaranteed to find the minimal energy conformation in some lattice
            model (at least for some sequences). So far, there are only algorithm
            that can find optimal conformations in the cubic
            lattice. In the more interesting case of the face-centered-cubic lattice
            (FCC), which is more protein-like, there are no results. One of the
            reasons is that for finding optimal conformations, one usually applies a
            branch-and-bound technique, and there are no reasonable bounds known for
            the FCC. We will give such a bound for Dill's HP-model on the FCC, which
            can be calculated by a dynamic programming approach.}
