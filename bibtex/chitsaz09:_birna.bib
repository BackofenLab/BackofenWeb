abstract = {We present biRNA, a novel algorithm for prediction of
            binding sites between two RNAs based on minimization
            of binding free energy. Similar to RNAup approach, we
            assume the binding free energy is the sum of
            accessibility and the interaction free energies. Our
            algorithm maintains tractability and speed and also
            has two important advantages over previous similar
            approaches: 1) it is able to predict multiple
            simultaneous binding sites and 2) it computes a more
            accurate interaction free energy by considering both
            intramolecular and intermolecular base
            pairing. Moreover, biRNA can handle crossing
            interactions as well as hairpins interacting in a
            zigzag fashion. 
            
            To deal with simultaneous
            accessibility of binding sites, our algorithm models
            their joint probability of being unpaired. Since
            computing the exact joint probability distribution is
            intractable, we approximate the joint probability by a
            polynomially representable graphical model namely a
            Chow-Liu tree-structured Markov Random
            Field. Experimental results show that biRNA
            outperforms RNAup and also support the accuracy of our
            approach. Our proposed Bayesian approximation of the
            Boltzmann joint probability distribution provides a
            powerful, novel framework that can also be utilized in
            other applications.}
