abstract = {MOTIVATION: Clustering according to sequence-structure 
            similarity has now become a generally accepted scheme for 
            ncRNA annotation. Its application to complete genomic 
            sequences as well as whole transcriptomes is therefore 
            desirable but hindered by extremely high computational 
            costs. RESULTS: We present a novel linear-time, 
            alignment-free method for comparing and clustering RNAs 
            according to sequence and structure. The approach scales to 
            datasets of hundreds of thousands of sequences. The quality 
            of the retrieved clusters has been benchmarked against known 
            ncRNA datasets and is comparable to state-of-the-art 
            sequence-structure methods although achieving speedups of 
            several orders of magnitude. A selection of applications 
            aiming at the detection of novel structural ncRNAs are 
            presented. Exemplarily, we predicted local structural 
            elements specific to lincRNAs likely functionally 
            associating involved transcripts to vital processes of the 
            human nervous system. In total, we predicted 349 local 
            structural RNA elements. AVAILABILITY: The GraphClust 
            pipeline is available on request. CONTACT:
