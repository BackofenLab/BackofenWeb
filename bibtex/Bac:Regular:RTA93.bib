abstract = {We examine the existential fragment of a feature logic,
            which is extended by regular path expressions. A
            regular path expression is a subterm relation, where
            the allowed paths for the subterms are restricted by a
            regular language. We will prove that satisfiability is
            decidable. This is achieved by setting up a
            quasi-terminating rewrite system. }
