abstract = {To gain insight into how genomic information is translated 
            into cellular and developmental programs, the Drosophila 
            model organism Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (modENCODE) 
            project is comprehensively mapping transcripts, histone 
            modifications, chromosomal proteins, transcription factors, 
            replication proteins and intermediates, and nucleosome 
            properties across a developmental time course and in 
            multiple cell lines. We have generated more than 700 data 
            sets and discovered protein-coding, noncoding, RNA 
            regulatory, replication, and chromatin elements, more than 
            tripling the annotated portion of the Drosophila genome. 
            Correlated activity patterns of these elements reveal a 
            functional regulatory network, which predicts putative new 
            functions for genes, reveals stage- and tissue-specific 
            regulators, and enables gene-expression prediction. Our 
            results provide a foundation for directed experimental and 
            computational studies in Drosophila and related species and 
            also a model for systematic data integration toward 
            comprehensive genomic and functional annotation.}
