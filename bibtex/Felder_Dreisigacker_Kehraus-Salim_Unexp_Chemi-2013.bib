abstract = {Marine myxobacteria (Enhygromyxa, Plesiocystis, 
            Pseudoenhygromyxa, Haliangium) are phylogenetically distant 
            from their terrestrial counterparts. Salimabromide is the 
            first natural product from the Plesiocystis/Enhygromyxa 
            clade of obligatory marine myxobacteria. Salimabromide has a 
            new tetracyclic carbon skeleton, comprising a brominated 
            benzene ring, a furano lactone residue, and a cyclohexane 
            ring, bridged by a seven-membered cyclic moiety. The 
            absolute configuration was deduced from experimental and 
            calculated CD data. Salimabromide revealed antibiotic 
            activity towards Arthrobacter cristallopoietes.}
