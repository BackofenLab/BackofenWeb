abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subtle alternative splicing events involving 
            tandem splice sites separated by a short (2-12 nucleotides) 
            distance are frequent and evolutionarily widespread in 
            eukaryotes, and a major contributor to the complexity of 
            transcriptomes and proteomes. However, these events have 
            been either omitted altogether in databases on alternative 
            splicing, or only the cases of experimentally confirmed 
            alternative splicing have been reported. Thus, a database 
            which covers all confirmed cases of subtle alternative 
            splicing as well as the numerous putative tandem splice 
            sites (which might be confirmed once more transcript data 
            becomes available), and allows to search for tandem splice 
            sites with specific features and download the results, is a 
            valuable resource for targeted experimental studies and 
            large-scale bioinformatics analyses of tandem splice sites. 
            Towards this goal we recently set up TassDB (Tandem Splice 
            Site DataBase, version 1), which stores data about 
            alternative splicing events at tandem splice sites separated 
            by 3 nt in eight species. DESCRIPTION: We have substantially 
            revised and extended TassDB. The currently available version 
            2 contains extensive information about tandem splice sites 
            separated by 2-12 nt for the human and mouse transcriptomes 
            including data on the conservation of the tandem motifs in 
            five vertebrates. TassDB2 offers a user-friendly interface 
            to search for specific genes or for genes containing tandem 
            splice sites with specific features as well as the 
            possibility to download result datasets. For example, users 
            can search for cases of alternative splicing where the 
            proportion of EST/mRNA evidence supporting the minor isoform 
            exceeds a specific threshold, or where the difference in 
            splice site scores is specified by the user. The predicted 
            impact of each event on the protein is also reported, along 
            with information about being a putative target for the 
            nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Links are provided to 
            the UCSC genome browser and other external resources. 
            CONCLUSION: TassDB2, available via http://www.tassdb.info, 
            provides comprehensive resources for researchers interested 
            in both targeted experimental studies and large-scale 
            bioinformatics analyses of short distance tandem splice 
            sites.}
