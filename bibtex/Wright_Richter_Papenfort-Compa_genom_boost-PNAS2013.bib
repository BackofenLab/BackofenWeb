abstract = {Small RNAs (sRNAs) constitute a large and heterogeneous 
            class of bacterial gene expression regulators. Much like 
            eukaryotic microRNAs, these sRNAs typically target multiple 
            mRNAs through short seed pairing, thereby acting as global 
            posttranscriptional regulators. In some bacteria, evidence 
            for hundreds to possibly more than 1,000 different sRNAs has 
            been obtained by transcriptome sequencing. However, the 
            experimental identification of possible targets and, 
            therefore, their confirmation as functional regulators of 
            gene expression has remained laborious. Here, we present a 
            strategy that integrates phylogenetic information to predict 
            sRNA targets at the genomic scale and reconstructs 
            regulatory networks upon functional enrichment and network 
            analysis (CopraRNA, for Comparative Prediction Algorithm for 
            sRNA Targets). Furthermore, CopraRNA precisely predicts the 
            sRNA domains for target recognition and interaction. When 
            applied to several model sRNAs, CopraRNA revealed additional 
            targets and functions for the sRNAs CyaR, FnrS, RybB, RyhB, 
            SgrS, and Spot42. Moreover, the mRNAs gdhA, lrp, marA, nagZ, 
            ptsI, sdhA, and yobF-cspC were suggested as regulatory hubs 
            targeted by up to seven different sRNAs. The verification of 
            many previously undetected targets by CopraRNA, even for 
            extensively investigated sRNAs, demonstrates its advantages 
            and shows that CopraRNA-based analyses can compete with 
            experimental target prediction approaches. A Web interface 
            allows high-confidence target prediction and efficient 
            classification of bacterial sRNAs.}
