abstract = {The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short 
            palindromic repeats/ CRISPR associated) system is a 
            prokaryotic defence mechanism against foreign genetic 
            elements. A plethora of CRISPR-Cas versions exist, with more 
            than 40 different Cas protein families and several different 
            molecular approaches to fight the invading DNA. One of the 
            key players in the system is the crRNA, which directs the 
            invader - degrading Cas protein complex to the invader. The 
            CRISPR-Cas types I and III use the Cas6 protein to generate 
            mature crRNAs. Here, we show that the Cas6 protein is 
            necessary for crRNA production but that additional Cas 
            proteins that form a Cascade-like complex are needed for 
            crRNA stability in the CRISPR-Cas type I-B system in 
            Haloferax volcanii in vivo. Deletion of the cas6 gene 
            results in loss of mature crRNAs and interference. However, 
            cells that have the complete cas gene cluster (cas1-8) 
            removed and are transformed with the cas6 gene are not able 
            to produce and stably maintain mature crRNAs. crRNA 
            production and stability is rescued only if cas5, 6 and 7 
            are present. Mutational analysis of the cas6 gene reveals 
            three amino acids (His41, Gly256 and Gly258) that are 
            essential for pre-crRNA cleavage, while the mutation of two 
            amino acids (Ser115 and Ser224) leads to an increase of 
            crRNA amounts. This is the first systematic in vivo analysis 
            of Cas6 protein variants. In addition, we show that the H. 
            volcanii I-B system contains a Cascade-like complex with a 
            Cas7, Cas5 and Cas6 core that protects the crRNA.}
