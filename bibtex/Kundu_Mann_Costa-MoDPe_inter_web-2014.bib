abstract = {SUMMARY:: MoDPepInt (Modular Domain Peptide Interaction) is 
            a new easy-to-use web server for the prediction of binding 
            partners for modular protein domains. Currently, we offer 
            models for SH2, SH3 and PDZ domains via the tools SH2PepInt, 
            SH3PepInt and PDZPepInt, respectively. More specifically, 
            our server offers predictions for 51 SH2 human domains and 
            69 SH3 human domains via single domain models, and 
            predictions for 226 PDZ domains across several species, via 
            43 multidomain models. All models are based on support 
            vector machines with different kernel functions ranging from 
            polynomial, to Gaussian, to advanced graph kernels. In this 
            way, we model non-linear interactions between amino acid 
            residues. Results were validated on manually curated 
            datasets achieving competitive performance against various 
            state-of-the-art approaches. Availability and 
            implementation: The MoDPepInt server is available under the 
            URL http://modpepint.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ CONTACT: :
