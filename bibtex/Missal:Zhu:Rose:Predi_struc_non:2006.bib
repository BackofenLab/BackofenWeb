abstract = {We present a survey for non-coding RNAs and other 
            structured RNA motifs in the genomes of Caenorhabditis 
            elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae using the RNAz program. 
            This approach explicitly evaluates comparative sequence 
            information to detect stabilizing selection acting on RNA 
            secondary structure. We detect 3,672 structured RNA motifs, 
            of which only 678 are known non-translated RNAs (ncRNAs) or 
            clear homologs of known C. elegans ncRNAs. Most of these 
            signals are located in introns or at a distance from known 
            protein-coding genes. With an estimated false positive rate 
            of about 50% and a sensitivity on the order of 50%, we 
            estimate that the nematode genomes contain between 3,000 and 
            4,000 RNAs with evolutionary conserved secondary structures. 
            Only a small fraction of these belongs to the known RNA 
            classes, including tRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, or microRNAs. A 
            relatively small class of ncRNA candidates is associated 
            with previously observed RNA-specific upstream elements.}
