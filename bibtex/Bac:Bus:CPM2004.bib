  abstract =	 {Selenoproteins contain the 21th amino acid
                  Selenocysteine, which is encoded 
                 by the STOP-codon UGA. For its 
                 insertion it requires a specific mRNA 
                 sequence downstream the UGA-codon that 
                 forms a hairpin-like structure (called 
                 Sec insertion sequence (SECIS)). 
                 Selenoproteins have gained much 
                 interest recently since they are very 
                 important for human health.
                 
                 In contrast, very little is known about 
                 selenoproteins. For example, there is 
                 only one solved crystal structure 
                 available. One reason for this is that 
                 one is not able to produce enough 
                 amount of selenoproteins by using 
                 recombinant expression in a system like
                 E.coli. The reason is that the 
                 insertion mechanisms are different 
                 between E.coli and eukaryotes. Thus, 
                 one has to redesign the human/mammalian 
                 selenoprotein for the expression in 
                 E.coli. In this paper, we introduce an 
                 polynomial-time algorithm for solving
                 the computational problem involved in 
                 this design, and we present results for 
                 known selenoproteins.},
