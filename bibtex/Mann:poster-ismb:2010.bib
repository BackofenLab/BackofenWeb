abstract = {Lattice proteins are a common abstraction to study protein structures and related topics. Certain studies require for high accuracy lattice protein models of given full atom protein structures. This hard computational problem was shown to be NP-complete. Various approaches to this problem have been suggested but only one, producing backbone-only models, is available for direct application.
            We present LatFit, a new tool to produce high accuracy lattice protein models from protein atomic co-ordinates. It generates backbone-only models as well as lattice models including side chains in various lattice types. The explicit representation of side chains prevents unnatural collapse during structural studies and enables the reconstruction of full atom protein data. LatFit implements a new distance root mean square deviation (RMSD) optimisation fitting procedure plus extends known coordinate RMSD optimising method. The program for high-throughput pipelines and a web interface for direct use are freely available at http://cpsp.informatik.uni-freiburg.de
            We place a large non-redundant set of high resolution proteins from SCOP database on three commonly used lattices: 3D cubic, face centred cubic, and knight's walk lattice. Both backbone and side chain models produced by LatFit show low deviation from the original data. Results for backbone-only models are competitive or superior to results from literature. Computed on-lattice fits including side chains show similar low deviations. To our knowledge, this is the first available tool and comprehensive study of lattice quality for on-lattice protein models including side chains.}
