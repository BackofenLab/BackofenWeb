abstract = {Lattice protein models are well studied abstractions of globular proteins. By
            discretizing the structure space and simplifying the energy model over regular
            proteins, they enable detailed studies of protein structure
            formation and evolution.
            But even in the simplest lattice protein models, the prediction of optimal
            structures is computationally hard. Therefore, often
            heuristic approaches are applied to find such conformations.
            Commonly, heuristic methods find only locally optimal solutions.
            Nevertheless, there exist methods that guarantee to predict globally optimal
            structures. 
            Currently only one such exact approach is
            publicly available, namely the Constraint-based
            Protein Structure Prediction (CPSP) method and variants. Here, we review exact
            approaches and derived methods. We discuss fundamental concepts like
            hydrophobic core construction and their use in optimal structure prediction as
            well as possible applications like combinations of different energy
            models.}
