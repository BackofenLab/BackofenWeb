            We developed a dynamic programming approach of computing common
            sequence/structure patterns between two RNAs given by their sequence
            and secondary structures. Common patterns between two RNAs are meant
            to share the same local sequential and structural properties.
            Nucleotides which are part of an RNA are linked together due to
            their phosphodiester or hydrogen bonds. These bonds describe the way
            how nucleotides are involved in patterns and thus delivers a
            bond-preserving matching definition. Based on this definition, we
            are able to compute all patterns between two RNAs in time O(nm)
            and space O(nm), where n and m are the lengths of the RNAs,
            respectively.  Our method is useful for describing and detecting
            local motifs and for detecting local regions of large RNAs although
            they do not share global similarities.}
