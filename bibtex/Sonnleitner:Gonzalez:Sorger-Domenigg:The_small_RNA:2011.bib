abstract = {Quorum sensing, a cell-to-cell communication system based 
            on small signal molecules, is employed by the human pathogen 
            Pseudomonas aeruginosa to regulate virulence and biofilm 
            development. Moreover, regulation by small trans-encoded 
            RNAs has become a focal issue in studies of virulence gene 
            expression of bacterial pathogens. In this study, we have 
            identified the small RNA PhrS as an activator of PqsR 
            synthesis, one of the key quorum-sensing regulators in P. 
            aeruginosa. Genetic studies revealed a novel mode of 
            regulation by a sRNA, whereby PhrS uses a base-pairing 
            mechanism to activate a short upstream open reading frame to 
            which the pqsR gene is translationally coupled. Expression 
            of phrS requires the oxygen-responsive regulator ANR. Thus, 
            PhrS is the first bacterial sRNA that provides a regulatory 
            link between oxygen availability and quorum sensing, which 
            may impact on oxygen-limited growth in P. aeruginosa 
            biofilms.}
