abstract = {The Classroom Assignment problem consists of scheduling
            a set of courses into a fixed number of rooms, given a fixed
            timetable. At the University of Munich, a classroom plan has to be
            created each semester after collecting timetables of all departments
            and wishes of teachers. This planning is very complex since a lot of
            constraints have to be met, e.g.  room size and equipment. Using
            constraint-based programming, we developed a prototype, called
            RoomPlan, that supports automatic creation of classroom plans. With
            RoomPlan a schedule can be created interactively within some minutes
            instead of some days. RoomPlan was presented at the Systems'99
            Computer exhibition in Munich.}
