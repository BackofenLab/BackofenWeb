abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The pandemic coronavirus disease 19 
            (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is marked by thromboembolic 
            events and an inflammatory response throughout the body, 
            including the brain. METHODS: Employing the machine learning 
            approach BrainDead we systematically screened for SARS-CoV-2 
            genome-derived single-stranded (ss) RNA fragments with high 
            potential to activate the viral RNA-sensing innate immune 
            receptors Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and/or TLR8. Analyzing 
            HEK TLR7/8 reporter cells we tested such RNA fragments with 
            respect to their potential to induce activation of human 
            TLR7 and TLR8 and to activate human macrophages, as well as 
            iPSC-derived human microglia, the resident immune cells in 
            the brain. RESULTS: We experimentally validated several 
            sequence-specific RNA fragment candidates out of the 
            SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments predicted in silico as activators 
            of human TLR7 and TLR8. Moreover, these SARS-CoV-2 ssRNAs 
            induced cytokine release from human macrophages and 
            iPSC-derived human microglia in a sequence- and 
            species-specific fashion. DISCUSSION: Our findings determine 
            TLR7 and TLR8 as key sensors of SARS-CoV-2-derived ssRNAs 
            and may deepen our understanding of the mechanisms how this 
            virus triggers, but also modulates an inflammatory response 
            through innate immune signaling.}
