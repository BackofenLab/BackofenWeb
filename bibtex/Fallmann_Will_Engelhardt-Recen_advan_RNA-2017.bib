abstract = {In the realm of nucleic acid structures, secondary 
            structure forms a conceptually important intermediate level 
            of description and explains the dominating part of the free 
            energy of structure formation. Secondary structures are well 
            conserved over evolutionary time-scales and for many classes 
            of RNAs evolve slower than the underlying primary sequences. 
            Given the close link between structure and function, 
            secondary structure is routinely used as a basis to explain 
            experimental findings. Recent technological advances, 
            finally, have made it possible to assay secondary structure 
            directly using high throughput methods. From a computational 
            biology point of view, secondary structures have a special 
            role because they can be computed efficiently using exact 
            dynamic programming algorithms. In this contribution we 
            provide a short overview of RNA folding algorithms, recent 
            additions and variations and address methods to align, 
            compare, and cluster RNA structures, followed by a tabular 
            summary of the most important software suites in the fields.}
