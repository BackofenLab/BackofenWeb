abstract = {We present a global search technique for finding the minimal
            conformation of a sequence in Dill's HP-lattice
            model~[Lau:89a,Lau:90a]. The HP-lattice model is 
            a simplified model of proteins, that has become a major tool for investigating
            general properties of protein folding.
            
            The search technique uses constraint programming for efficiently pruning the
            search tree.  We state the problem of structure prediction in the HP-lattice
            model and describe our implementation using the Oz-system.}
