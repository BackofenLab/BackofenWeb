abstract = {Dosage compensation in Drosophila is an epigenetic 
            phenomenon utilizing proteins and long noncoding RNAs 
            (lncRNAs) for transcriptional upregulation of the male X 
            chromosome. Here, by using UV crosslinking followed by deep 
            sequencing, we show that two enzymes in the Male-Specific 
            Lethal complex, MLE RNA helicase and MSL2 ubiquitin ligase, 
            bind evolutionarily conserved domains containing tandem 
            stem-loops in roX1 and roX2 RNAs in vivo. These domains 
            constitute the minimal RNA unit present in multiple copies 
            in diverse arrangements for nucleation of the MSL complex. 
            MLE binds to these domains with distinct ATP-independent and 
            ATP-dependent behavior. Importantly, we show that different 
            roX RNA domains have overlapping function, since only 
            combinatorial mutations in the tandem stem-loops result in 
            severe loss of dosage compensation and consequently 
            male-specific lethality. We propose that repetitive 
            structural motifs in lncRNAs could provide plasticity during 
            multiprotein complex assemblies to ensure efficient 
            targeting in cis or in trans along chromosomes.}
