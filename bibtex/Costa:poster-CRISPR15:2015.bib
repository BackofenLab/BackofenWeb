abstract = {Automated annotation of CRISPR-cas loci in newly sequenced genomes would be valuable both
            for general purposes of comparative genomics of archaea and bacteria, and for the progress of CRISPR research.  
            For a comprehensive analysis, several tasks have to be performed, among which the most important are: 1) the 
            correct prediction of repeat orientation, 2) a characterization of the repeats in terms of sequence and structure 
            to infer repeat evolution, and 3) annotation of the associated loci subtype according to the composition of cas 
            genes. We will discuss characteristics of CRISPRstrand and CRISPRmap, the two automated solutions we have introduced to solve the first two tasks. 
            A crucial task is the annotation of loci subtypes. We present a solution to this problem that relies on a novel 
            similarity notion for the interference modules. Loci annotation is achieved by nearest neighbor classification, 
            which yields high consistency with respect to the current subtype classification. The annotation pipeline also 
            allows us to investigate the evolutionary modularity of adaptation and interference modules}
