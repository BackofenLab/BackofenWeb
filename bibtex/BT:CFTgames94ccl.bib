abstract = {We show, that the axiomatization of rational trees in the language of
            features given by Smolka & Treinen 1992 is complete. In contrast to other
            completeness proofs that have been given in this field, we employ the
            method of Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Games. The result extends previous
            results on complete axiomatizations of rational trees in the language of
            constructor equations (Comon & Lescanne 1988, Maher 1988) or in a
            weaker feature language as given by Backofen & Smolka 1993.
