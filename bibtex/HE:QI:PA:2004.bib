abstract = {{Homology modeling is an effect method for structure prediction when suitable template with significant sequence identity exists; but sometimes, traditional methods for searching templates such as PSI-BLAST can not find proper homologous proteins for the target protein because of very low sequence identity or bad structural quality and in such cases homology modeling is always impossible. Herein we describe a method for detecting distant homologous proteins which have low sequence identity with the target protein but may share the same fold patterns by involving the structure information into the sequence alignment.}}
